# Higham Chapter 23, Theorem 23.2: recursive matrix model

This module supplies the recursive block-matrix carrier, algebraic instances,
and projection lemmas used by the literal recursive Strassen analysis for
Theorem 23.2. Declaration names and bodies are preserved from the historical
Chapter 23 implementation.
