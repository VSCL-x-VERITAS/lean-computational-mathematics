# Higham Problems 23.8--23.9: recursive inversion

Problem 23.8's block inverse identity and exact operation-count recurrence,
together with the Problem 23.9 upper-triangular specialization. The latter is
intentionally co-located here because it is a direct specialization of the
Problem 23.8 formula.
