# Higham Theorem 19.6: canonical actual-source exports

The bare-`FPModel`, source-constructed, fully swap-aware implementation proof
was originally assembled while developing Theorem 20.7.  These Chapter 19
exports make that route discoverable under its source theorem: no
`StageDataReady`, `StrongStageModel`, row-policy, or target-bearing local
budget is assumed.
