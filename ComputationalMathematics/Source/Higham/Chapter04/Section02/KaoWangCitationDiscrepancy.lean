# Higham Section 4.2: the Kao--Wang citation discrepancy

Higham, *Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms*, 2nd ed., Chapter 4,
p. 82, says that minimizing the running bound (4.3) is NP-hard and cites
Kao--Wang (2000).  The cited paper proves a precise but different statement:
its input is a multiset of nonzero integers, its search space is all binary
addition trees, and its cost is the sum of the absolute values of the *exact*
internal-node sums.

This file fixes the mathematical scope of that citation.  It gives a
computable integer-tree version of Kao--Wang's MAT/AT objective, embeds it into
the Chapter 4 `InsertionScheduleTree` model, and proves that it agrees with
Higham's (4.3) budget in exact arithmetic.  It also gives a standard-model
witness showing that the exact cost and the rounded (4.3) budget are not the
same objective for a general `FPModel`.

No NP-hardness theorem is asserted here.  The literal sentence in Higham is
not a uniquely formalizable complexity statement: (4.3) contains computed
intermediate sums, but the book fixes neither a floating-point format/model
nor an encoded decision problem, while Kao--Wang proves hardness for a
different exact-integer objective.  The discrepancy theorem below makes that
scope mismatch explicit.  The exact reduction proposition at the end records
the paper-level theorem one would use only after separately choosing an
encoding and a complexity framework; it is not assumed and is not silently
reported as a proof of the printed computed-bound claim.
