# Higham Chapter 6: the dual of the dual norm

Higham states after (6.2) that the dual of the dual norm is the original
norm.  The first theorem below exposes Mathlib's general Hahn--Banach
isometry into the continuous double dual.  The second theorem specializes
the statement to the source-facing `CVec`/`IsComplexVectorNorm` interface
used throughout this repository: evaluation at `x` has maximum `ν x` over
all complex-linear functionals of dual norm at most one.

/-- Source-facing finite-dimensional form of the duality theorem following
Higham (6.2).  For every nontrivial `C^n`, the maximum of `|φ(x)|` over
complex-linear functionals with dual norm at most one is exactly `ν x`.

The maximizing functional is constructed by the repository's Hahn--Banach
norming-functional bridge; the upper bound follows from the defining dual
norm inequality. -/
