/-- Higham, 2nd ed., Section 26.2, pp. 475-476: one multidirectional-search
iteration with at most `fuel` contraction retries.

The input is first reordered so that `v₀` is a best current vertex.  A
successful reflection is expanded when the expanded simplex has the larger
maximum; otherwise the reflected simplex is accepted.  An unsuccessful
reflection contracts the simplex.  A contraction improving on the current
simplex is accepted, while a non-improving contraction restarts the reflection
test about the same `v₀`, with one less unit of fuel.  `none` records that this
finite observation budget did not witness completion of the iteration; it
makes no termination or optimization-correctness assumption. -/

    (input : MDSSimplex n) : Option (MDSSimplex n) :=

finite number of contraction retries reaches one of the source's accepted
reflection, expansion, or contraction branches. -/

def Converged {n : ℕ} (tol : ℝ) (s : MDSSimplex n) : Prop :=

/-- General finite execution semantics for the MDS method: stop exactly when
the printed test (26.3) holds; otherwise complete one reflection/expansion/
contraction iteration and continue.  This trace records algorithm control flow
only.  In particular it assumes neither existence of a maximizer nor
stationarity, convergence, or global correctness of the returned simplex. -/
