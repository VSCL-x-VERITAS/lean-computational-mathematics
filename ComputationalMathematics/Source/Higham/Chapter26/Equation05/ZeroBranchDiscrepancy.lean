/-! # Higham Chapter 26, Equation 26.5: Zero-Branch Discrepancy

The counterexample showing that the sentence following equation (26.5) needs a nonzero-branch qualification.
-/

/-- The printed sentence after (26.5) needs a nonzero-branch qualification.
For `p = 0, q = 1`, one of its two signs is zero; its only cube root is zero,
and Vieta's division formula does not produce a depressed-cubic root. -/
