# Insertion schedules and greedy optimality

This reusable layer defines list-shaped insertion schedules, their exact merge
and weighted-depth costs, contraction and exchange machinery, and the greedy
optimality theorem. The long exchange proof remains cohesive because private
helpers in its middle are reused by later branches.
