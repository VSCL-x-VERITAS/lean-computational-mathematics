# Higham Chapter 9 Formalization Report - "LU Factorization and Linear Equations"

> **PDF-first rerun (2026-07-19): selected-scope gate PASS after repair.**
> The local PDF has **15**, not 14, named items: Algorithm 9.2, Lemma 9.6,
> and Theorems 9.1, 9.3--9.5, 9.7--9.15.  The previous summary silently
> omitted Theorem 9.7 and described the real developments for Theorems
> 9.8--9.11 as if they covered the source's complex domain.  The rerun adds
> `HighamChapter9Theorem97Classification.lean` (the exact real extremal
> classification, including the reduced-matrix growth history, the printed
> `D M [T | alpha d]` form, the tie convention, no-interchange conclusion,
> and an executable trace-existence theorem),
> `HighamChapter9Theorem99Closure.lean` (the complete no-pivot reduced-history
> statement for the real diagonal-dominance subdomain), and the complex
> source-domain closure modules for Theorems 9.8--9.11.  In particular,
> Theorem 9.8 is universal over arbitrary admissible row/column permutations;
> 9.9 includes row/column diagonal dominance, no-pivot LU, the full (9.5)
> reduced history and the column-dominant multiplier bound; and 9.10--9.11
> construct genuine complex GEPP traces rather than taking the growth result
> as a premise.  The historical status text below is retained for provenance

> `HighamChapter9CompletePivotSharpClosure.lean` proves the
> consecutive-pivot Hadamard constraints directly from
> `higham9_8_CompletePivotGECPUTrace`, derives Wilkinson's sharp product bound
> without a caller-supplied pivot sequence or target inequality, and defines
> `higham9_14_completePivotReducedHistoryGrowthFactor` as the supremum of the

## Source and scope
- Edition: Higham, *Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms*, 2nd ed. (SIAM, 2002).
- Chapter: 9, "LU Factorization and Linear Equations" (printed pp. 157-193).
- Source file: `higham-split/sources/chapter-pdfs/1.9780898718027.ch9.pdf`.
- Mode: core.
- Parallel split: 2 (chapters 7-12).
- Planning documents consulted: blueprint, Split 2 section of `split_primary_contracts.md`, `chapter_index.md`.
- Selected-scope gate: **PASS** (2026-07-09, milestone M28, commit `65f1f8d1`).
  All 14 primary labels (Theorems 9.1, 9.3-9.5, 9.8-9.15, Lemma 9.6,
  Algorithm 9.2) and the numbered-equation families (9.1)-(9.27) are
  represented by proved source-facing declarations. The three formerly
  citation-blocked rows were all closed from acquired sources:
  eq. (9.16) Foster rook-pivoting bound `rho_n <= 1.5 n^{(3/4)ln n}` CLOSED at
  M25 (Foster Theorems 1+3 and Lemma 2 formalized end-to-end;
  `higham9_16_RookPivotGEUTrace_growthFactorEntry_le_fosterBound*`,
  `higham9_16_fosterT_le_exp`); Theorem 9.11 Bohte banded bound
  `rho <= 2^{2p-1}-(p-1)2^{p-2}` CLOSED at M28 (Bohte [146, 1975] §5 formalized,
  `higham9_11_banded_GEPPUTrace_growthFactorEntry_le_bohteBound`, with the
  near-attainability witness `>= 115` at `n=9, p=4` from M27); Theorem 9.15's
  exact Barrlund (9.27) form CLOSED 2026-07-07
  (`higham9_15_barrlund_deltaL_bound` / `_deltaU_bound` from Barrlund [90,
  1991]). The gate-history paragraphs below are retained as an audit trail;
  where an older paragraph says FAIL or OPEN it is superseded by this line and
  the dated milestone entries (M25/M27/M28). (Header brought in line with the
  Lean state and M28 milestone record on 2026-07-11, split-2 audit pass.)
  **UPDATE (2026-07-06, web-authorized pass):** the *analytic core* of
  eq. (9.14) — Wilkinson's actual 1961 growth-factor bound — was PROVED
  axiom-clean as `higham9_14_wilkinson_ratio_bound`. **UPDATE (2026-07-07
  pass): eq. (9.14) is now CLOSED end-to-end at the model level.** The
  Gaussian-elimination iterate model (`higham9_14_geIterate`, the trailing
  Schur-complement chain `S_m = L₂₂U₂₂` with its own LU certificate) is
  formalized, the segment Hadamard constraints are discharged from the
  complete-pivoting invariant (every entry of `S_m` bounded by the stage
  pivot — the defining property of complete pivoting), and the source growth
  bound `rho_n^c ≤ √n·(2·3^{1/2}⋯n^{1/(n-1)})^{1/2}` is proved both for the
  final-`U` max-entry growth factor
  (`higham9_14_completePivot_growthFactorEntry_le_wilkinsonBound`) and in the
  all-iterates form matching the source growth-factor definition
  (`higham9_14_completePivot_iterate_entry_le_wilkinsonBound_mul`). The
  complete-pivoting invariant and pivot-nonzeroness are explicit hypotheses of
  record (they encode "the factorization was produced by complete pivoting on
  a nonsingular matrix", not any growth property); the executable
  GECP-algorithm trace bridge discharging the invariant from a pivot-choice
  trace remains a visible DEFER row below. **UPDATE (2026-07-07, source PDFs
  delivered):** Theorem 9.15's exact Barrlund (9.27) normwise form is now
  CLOSED (`higham9_15_barrlund_deltaL_bound` / `_deltaU_bound`) from the
  delivered Barrlund [90, 1991]; only eq. (9.16) Foster (source in hand,
  formalization in progress) and Thm 9.11 Bohte general-`p` (paper not located)
  remain open. See the completion assessment and not-proved ledger below. (An
  earlier revision of this file recorded PASS with "no open items"; that
  overstated the Lean state and is corrected here per the project's
  documentation-honesty rule that a citation is not a proof and a conditional
  transfer does not close a stronger source row.)

Primary Lean modules: `NumStability/Algorithms/HighamChapter9.lean` and
`NumStability/Algorithms/HighamChapter9DoolittleClosure.lean`
(source-shaped executable closure); reusable LU, triangular solve, growth-factor,
tridiagonal, and special-matrix foundations are imported from the `LU/*` modules
and shared analysis files.

## Fresh executable-source closure (2026-07-18)

The disputed pages were reread from the source (printed pp. 163-164; PDF pp.
7-8). For an upper entry, Lemma 8.4 gives a residual bounded by `gamma_k`
times the absolute prefix products plus the stored `U_kj`; the lower-entry
formula analogously ends with the stored product `L_ik U_kk`. These are exactly
the two triangular pieces of the corresponding component of
`|Lhat||Uhat|`. They are not bounds by the stored output alone.

`higham9_2_flMulSubFold_source_residual_abs_le` and
`higham9_2_flMulSubFold_div_source_residual_abs_le` derive those estimates from
the actual sequential `fl_mul`/`fl_sub`/`fl_div` operations. The literal loop
certificate `higham9_2_rectRoundedLoopSourceCertificate` feeds
`higham9_3_rectRoundedLoop_source_backward_error` and the standard square and
permuted `LUBackwardError` adapters. The no-budget executable consumers are:

- `higham9_4_rectRoundedLoop_square_lu_solve_backward_error_source`;
- `higham9_5_wilkinson_source_bound_of_PermutedPartialPivotGEPPUTrace_rectRoundedLoop_source`;
- the `higham9_14_*rectRoundedLoop_square_sourceResidual*` `f(u)` and `h(u)`
  families.

The older budget-compression declarations remain available as conditional
compatibility surfaces, but they are no longer used to claim the source
theorems. `higham9_3_outputOnlyCompression_fails_under_cancellation` formally
records the smallest cancellation obstruction to that obsolete adapter shape.

## Equations
Equations (9.1)-(9.27) are accounted for by the source-facing declaration
families above: pivot/Doolittle and Schur-complement identities (`higham9_1_*`,
`higham9_2_*`), backward-error and solve equations (`higham9_3_*`,
`higham9_4_*`, `higham9_5_*`), block/sine/Fourier and growth-factor witnesses
(`higham9_8_*` through `higham9_13_*`), tridiagonal data and recurrences
(`higham9_18_*`, `higham9_19_*`), source `f(u)`/`h(u)` bounds and model
equations (`higham9_14_*`), and LU sensitivity operators/normalized systems
(`higham9_15_*`).

## Skipped items (reason codes)
| Source location | Summary | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Historical notes, implementation commentary, and LAPACK-style prose | background and software guidance | non-mathematical/editorial |
| Empirical performance remarks | qualitative observations | empirical, no formalizable theorem statement |

## Benchmark-reserved (identifiers only - NOT formalized as chapter work)
Problems 9.1-9.18 and Appendix A solutions 9.2-9.11, 9.13 are
benchmark-reserved. Some reusable declarations carry `higham_problem9_*` names
from earlier library work; they are not new exercise transcriptions for this
chapter pass.
The rendered PDF lists Problem 9.12, so it is included in this reserved range
even though the current planning ledgers omit that identifier.

## Open selected-scope items (not-proved ledger)
Three selected rows are citation-only in the book (Higham states them without
proof) and remain open. Each carries honest partial/conditional Lean surfaces
(the locally provable arithmetic, monotone consumers, and solve/inverse
bridges) but the core imported inequality is NOT proved locally; the missing
foundation is the cited external proof, which is either unavailable or research-
grade. A conditional wrapper that takes the target bound as a hypothesis does
not close these rows.

This is the rigorous quadratic-form variant of (9.27) (Chang-Stehlé-type); the EXACT book form `‖G‖_F/(1−‖G‖₂)` under only `‖G‖₂<1` still requires Barrlund's min-factor control and the row stays OPEN with that residual gap | prove the self-majorant inequality or route it through an equivalent Ch6/7 spectral surface | CLOSED (2026-07-07, Barrlund [90, 1991] delivered): exact book (9.27) form proved as `higham9_15_barrlund_deltaL_bound` / `higham9_15_barrlund_deltaU_bound` (`‖ΔL‖_F ≤ ‖L‖₂‖G‖_F/(1−‖G‖₂)`, `‖ΔU‖_F ≤ ‖U‖₂‖G‖_F/(1−‖G‖₂)` under `‖G‖₂<1`); the rigorous quadratic-form homotopy variant `higham9_15_rigorous_lu_perturbation_combined_bound` is retained as a stronger-hypothesis companion |

All other selected primary labels (Theorems 9.1, 9.3-9.5, 9.8 lower bound,
9.9, 9.10, 9.12-9.14 endpoints, Lemma 9.6, Algorithm 9.2) are represented by
proved Lean declarations, with Matrix-facing wrappers for the Theorem 9.11-9.13
API surfaces. The section-9.4 growth illustrations of Theorem 9.8 are now
complete for all three matrices Higham names: `S_n` (9.12), `V_n` (9.13), and
the Hadamard matrix (`rho_n >= n`, added this pass).

**Eq. (9.14) closure record (2026-07-07).** The complete-pivoting growth
upper bound `rho_n^c ≤ n^{1/2}(2·3^{1/2}⋯n^{1/(n-1)})^{1/2}` (Wilkinson
[1229, 1961], cited without proof in §9.4) is CLOSED at the model level by the

`higham9_14_completePivot_iterate_entry_le_wilkinsonBound_mul` (every entry of
every reduced matrix — the all-iterates source growth factor).
Hypotheses of record: `LUFactSpec` for the (permuted) matrix, nonzero pivots,
and the complete-pivoting invariant `hCP` (every entry of the stage-`m`
reduced matrix bounded by the stage pivot `|U_{m,m}|`) — the defining
pivot-choice property of complete pivoting, not a growth assumption.

## Hidden-hypothesis summary
- Exact factorization wrappers state determinant, pivot, diagonal-dominance,
  tridiagonal, SPD, nonnegative, M-matrix, sign-equivalence, or trace
  certificate hypotheses explicitly rather than deriving them silently.
- The source-facing rounded GE/solve wrappers derive their local residual
  model from the literal loop. Older budget-certificate wrappers remain
  explicitly conditional compatibility APIs and are not used for closure.
- Theorem 9.14 source `f(u)`/`h(u)` endpoints separate model assumptions from
  actual triangular-solve wrappers; gamma-specialized wrappers record the
  required `gammaValid` hypotheses.
- Theorem 9.15 sensitivity results expose inverse/product/resolvent/majorant
  assumptions through named predicates and lemmas; no hidden nonsingularity
  premise is folded into a conclusion.

## Verification
- Recent commands:
  - 2026-07-18 source-residual closure: `lake env lean NumStability/Algorithms/HighamChapter9DoolittleClosure.lean` passed; `lake build NumStability.Algorithms.HighamChapter9DoolittleClosure` passed (`Build completed successfully (3046 jobs)`). `#print axioms` for the fold/divide residual lemmas, literal-loop certificate, 9.3 standard/permuted adapters, 9.4, 9.5, both principal 9.14 endpoints, and the cancellation theorem reported only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. The focused placeholder/escape scan and scoped `git diff --check` were clean; only pre-existing upstream linter warnings were replayed.
  - `lake env lean NumStability/Algorithms/HighamChapter9.lean` passed after the final Theorem 9.13 Matrix-wrapper increment.
  - `lake build NumStability.Algorithms.HighamChapter9` passed: `Build completed successfully (3045 jobs)`.
  - `lake env lean --tstack=131072 examples/LibraryLookup.lean` passed after the final lookup additions.
  - `#print axioms` audits for the newly added Theorem 9.12 and Theorem 9.13 Matrix wrappers all reported only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
  - `git diff --check` and added-line placeholder scans were clean before each synced increment.
  - 2026-07-06 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass): re-verified current `main` and added the Hadamard section-9.4 growth application. `lake build NumStability.Algorithms.HighamChapter9` passed (`Build completed successfully (3045 jobs)`); `#print axioms` for the five new `higham9_8_hadamard*` declarations reported only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; hygiene and `git diff --check` clean. Corrected the selected-scope gate from an overstated PASS to FAIL (citation-blocked) with the not-proved ledger above.
  - 2026-07-06 (same pass, continued): built the **Hadamard determinant inequality** foundation for eq. (9.14), a Mathlib gap, in the `HadamardDeterminantInequality` section: `higham9_amgm_prod_le_one_of_sum_eq_card`, `higham9_posDef_det_le_prod_diag` (`det M ≤ ∏ Mᵢᵢ`, PosDef), `higham9_hadamard_det_sq_le_prod_row_sq` (`(det A)² ≤ ∏ᵢ∑ⱼAᵢⱼ²`), and `higham9_hadamard_det_sq_le_pow_maxEntryNorm` (`(det A)² ≤ nⁿ·(maxEntryNorm A)^{2n}`). All four axiom-clean; three separate build/axiom/sync cycles, all `3045 jobs` PASS. Remaining for (9.14): the complete-pivoting combinatorial assembly (nested leading-minor = product of successive pivots, plus the growth recursion producing Wilkinson's `2·3^{1/2}⋯` product). The repo already provides `LUFactSpec.det_eq_prod_U_diag` (full det = ∏ pivots) and a complete-pivoting entry-≤-pivot invariant; the nested/recursive assembly across all `n` stages remains open and is research-grade.
  - 2026-07-06 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, web-authorized): **formalized Wilkinson's complete-pivoting growth bound (analytic core of eq. 9.14)** as `higham9_14_wilkinson_ratio_bound`, following the exact proof reconstructed in Bisain, Edelman & Urschel, "A New Upper Bound for the Growth Factor in Gaussian Elimination with Complete Pivoting" (arXiv:2312.00994, 2024), §2, which restates Wilkinson [1229, 1961, Eq. 4.15]. The theorem takes the Hadamard pivot constraint `∏_{i≤k} p i ≤ √(k^k)·(p k)^k` (the exact output of `higham9_14_abs_prod_leadingPivots_le_of_entries_le` under complete pivoting, where `‖A^(k)‖_max = p k`) and concludes `p 1 / p n ≤ higham9_14_completePivotWilkinsonBound n`, via the log/telescoping argument (no LP duality needed). Build PASS; axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. This is the hard, cited mathematical content of (9.14). The row is NOT yet fully closed: the remaining piece is the Gaussian-elimination iterate model (completely-pivoted Schur-complement chain, growth factor = max_k p_k/p_n) that discharges the pivot-constraint hypothesis for an actual matrix — pure bookkeeping over the now-proved analytic core.
  - 2026-07-06 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): proved the **pivot-to-leading-minor** step for eq. (9.14). Added `higham9_14_LUFactSpec_leadingSubmatrix_det_eq_prod_U_diag` (`det of the k×k leading principal submatrix of A = ∏ of the first k pivots`, proved via the leading-block factorization `A_k = L_k·U_k`, the tail terms vanishing by lower-triangularity) and `higham9_14_abs_prod_leadingPivots_le_of_entries_le` (`|∏ first-k pivots| ≤ √(kᵏ)·Mᵏ` whenever every leading-submatrix entry is `≤ M`, combining the new leading-minor identity with `higham9_hadamard_det_sq_le_pow_maxEntryNorm`). The entry bound `M` is an explicit hypothesis — this is an honest reduction of (9.14) to the still-open global per-stage entry invariant, not a proof of the full upper bound. `lake build NumStability.Algorithms.HighamChapter9` PASS (`Build completed successfully (3045 jobs)`); `#print axioms` for both new declarations reported only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. Remaining for (9.14): promote the per-stage invariant `higham9_1_completePivot_active_entry_ratio_abs_le_one` to a global `all leading-submatrix entries ≤ |a_11|` bound, then the pivot recursion. Gate remains FAIL (this row still OPEN; the three other open rows unchanged).
  - 2026-07-06 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): added the **consecutive leading-minor / pivot relation** `higham9_14_leadingSubmatrix_det_succ` (`det B_{k+1} = pivot_{k+1} · det B_k`, division-free form, via `Fin.prod_univ_castSucc` on the leading-minor identity). This is the classical "pivot = ratio of consecutive leading principal minors" recursion step of Wilkinson's complete-pivoting argument. Build PASS (3045 jobs); axiom-clean. Gate still FAIL: (9.14) still OPEN (global entry invariant + full recursion remain).
  - 2026-07-06 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): added the full-matrix Hadamard pivot-product bound `higham9_14_abs_prod_pivots_le_maxEntryNorm` (`|∏ pivots| = |det A| ≤ √(nⁿ)·(maxEntryNorm A)ⁿ`, via `LUFactSpec.det_eq_prod_U_diag` + Hadamard max-entry bound) — a growth-factor-facing surface with the concrete `maxEntryNorm A` entry bound (no extra hypothesis). Build PASS; axiom-clean. This completes the clean, bounded (9.14) foundation toolkit (leading-minor identity, Hadamard pivot-product bound, consecutive-minor recursion, full-matrix bound). The remaining (9.14) step — the global "all completely-pivoted leading-submatrix entries ≤ |a_11|" invariant — has no small next lemma: it requires building a multi-stage Gaussian-elimination reduced-matrix induction (absent from `LU/GrowthFactor.lean`, which has only per-stage `higham9_1_completePivot_active_entry_ratio_abs_le_one`), a research-grade multi-session effort.
  - 2026-07-07 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass): **closed eq. (9.14) end-to-end at the model level.** Increment A: `higham9_14_wilkinson_max_pivot_bound` (sequence level: under the segment Hadamard constraints `∏_{i=m}^{k} p i ≤ √(j^j)·(p m)^j`, `j = k-m+1`, EVERY pivot satisfies `p k / p 1 ≤ WilkinsonBound n` — proved by applying the analytic core to the reversed truncated sequence `t ↦ p (k+1-t)` and enlarging `WilkinsonBound k → WilkinsonBound n` by monotonicity) plus the product form `higham9_14_wilkinson_pivot_le_bound_mul`; synced to main @4681efed after a full `lake build` (3800 jobs) PASS. Increment B+C: the GE-iterate model — `higham9_14_geShift`, `higham9_14_geIterate` (`S_m = L₂₂U₂₂`, the trailing-block product, i.e. the stage-`m` reduced matrix), `higham9_14_geIterate_LUFactSpec` (the trailing blocks are an exact LU certificate for `S_m`), `higham9_14_geIterate_zero_apply` (`S_0 = A`), `higham9_14_geIterate_row_zero` (row 0 of `S_m` = row `m` of `U`), `higham9_14_completePivot_segment_pivot_bound` (segment Hadamard constraint from a stage entry bound, via `higham9_14_abs_prod_leadingPivots_le_of_entries_le` applied to the iterate's certificate) — and the source-facing growth theorems `higham9_14_completePivot_growthFactorEntry_le_wilkinsonBound` and `higham9_14_completePivot_iterate_entry_le_wilkinsonBound_mul` (all-iterates form, Definition 9.6). Hypotheses of record: `LUFactSpec n A L U`, `∀ i, U i i ≠ 0`, and the complete-pivoting invariant (every entry of `S_m` bounded by `|U_{m,m}|`). `lake build NumStability.Algorithms.HighamChapter9` PASS; `#print axioms` for all new declarations `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. Gate remains FAIL on the three remaining citation rows (9.16 Foster, 9.11 Bohte, 9.15 Barrlund-Sun self-majorant).
  - 2026-07-07 (same pass, continued): started the (9.15) Barrlund homotopy foundation. Added `higham9_15_leadingSubmatrix_mul_of_lower_left` / `higham9_15_leadingSubmatrix_mul_of_upper_right` (the leading `k×k` block of `L·X` resp. `X·U` factors through the leading blocks when the outer factor is triangular), `higham9_15_leadingSubmatrix_det_triple` (`det B_k(L·M·U) = det B_k(M)·∏ first-k U-pivots`, `L` unit lower), and `higham9_15_perturbed_leading_minor_eq` (`A+ΔA = L(I+G)U` with `G = L⁻¹ΔA U⁻¹` via inverse certificates, hence `det B_k(A+ΔA) = det B_k(I+G)·∏ first-k pivots`). This is the existence engine for Barrlund's (9.27) homotopy route: under `‖G‖₂ < 1` the leading minors of `I+tG` are nonsingular for `t ∈ [0,1]`, so `A+tΔA` retains an LU factorization along the whole path. Remaining for (9.27): submatrix spectral-norm contraction (`‖B_k(G)‖₂ ≤ ‖G‖₂ < 1` ⟹ `det B_k(I+G) ≠ 0`), continuity of the LU factors along the path, and the connectedness argument selecting the small branch of the quadratic self-majorant `s ≤ ‖G‖_F + s²` (which composes with the existing `higham9_15_normalized_G_*` split lemmas). Web-acquisition attempts this pass: Foster (1997) and Sun (1992) remain paywalled (ScienceDirect 403, author site unreachable, archive blocked); Wu-Huang (ANZIAM 2008, obtained) gives only first-order bounds, not the rigorous (9.27). Build PASS; new declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-07 (same pass, continued): completed the (9.15)/(9.27) homotopy **nonsingularity leg**. Added `higham9_15_opNorm2Le_leadingSubmatrix` (an `opNorm2Le M c` certificate transfers to every leading principal submatrix, by zero-padding the test vector), `higham9_15_det_one_add_ne_zero_of_opNorm2Le_lt_one` (`det(I + B) ≠ 0` when `opNorm2Le B c` with `c < 1`: a kernel vector would satisfy `‖v‖ = ‖Bv‖ ≤ c‖v‖ < ‖v‖`), and `higham9_15_perturbed_leading_minor_ne_zero` (combining these with `higham9_15_perturbed_leading_minor_eq`: every leading minor of `A + ΔA` is nonzero when `G = L⁻¹ΔA U⁻¹` has a sub-unit operator-2-norm certificate and the pivots are nonzero). Together with the previous increment this proves: under Barrlund's hypothesis, `A + t·ΔA` retains an LU factorization for every `t ∈ [0,1]`. Remaining for the full (9.27): continuity of the LU factors along the path and the connectedness/small-branch argument for the quadratic self-majorant. Build PASS; new declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-07 (same pass, continued): added the **branch-selection (connectedness) leg** for the rigorous (9.27)-type homotopy bound: `higham9_15_selfMajorant_band_avoidance` (any point satisfying the quadratic self-majorant `s ≤ g + s²` with `g < 1/4` lies outside the open band between the roots of `x² - x + g`) and `higham9_15_selfMajorant_path_small_branch` (a continuous path on `[0,1]` with `s 0 = 0` satisfying the self-majorant pointwise ends at `s 1 ≤ (1-√(1-4g))/2`, by the intermediate value theorem against the forbidden band). Remaining for (9.27): continuity of the LU factors along `A + t·ΔA` (via the now-proved nonsingular leading minors and Cramer-style formulas) and the final assembly; the exact Barrlund `‖G‖_F/(1-‖G‖₂)` form additionally needs the min-factor control (see `higham9_15_normalized_G_frobNorm_ratio_bound_of_min_factor_bound`). Build PASS; new declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-07 (same pass, continued): added the **pivot-transfer leg**: `higham9_1_LUFactSpec_pivots_ne_zero_of_leading_minors_ne_zero` (product of the first `k` pivots = `k`-th leading minor, so nonvanishing minors force nonzero pivots in any exact LU certificate) and `higham9_15_perturbed_LUFactSpec_pivots_ne_zero` (composition with the perturbed-minor nonsingularity: under Barrlund's smallness every LU certificate of `A+ΔA` — hence of every `A+t·ΔA` — has nonzero pivots, enabling `higham9_1_lu_unique_of_pivots_ne_zero` along the homotopy path). Precise remaining (9.15) targets, in order: (i) Schur-minor identity `det B_{k+1}(A) = A₀₀ · det B_k(higham9_1_firstSchurComplement A)` and the existence-from-minors induction over `higham9_1_lu_exists_of_firstSchurComplement`; (ii) continuity of the Doolittle entries in `t` where pivots are nonzero; (iii) assembly of the rigorous quadratic-form bound via `higham9_15_selfMajorant_path_small_branch` and the `higham9_15_normalized_G_*` split lemmas; the exact Barrlund `‖G‖_F/(1-‖G‖₂)` form additionally needs min-factor control. Build PASS; both declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-07 (same pass, continued): completed the **existence leg** of the (9.15) homotopy and, en route, the existence direction of **Theorem 9.1**. Added `higham9_1_det_eq_pivot_mul_firstSchurComplement_det` (`det A = A₀₀·det(luFirstSchurComplement A)`, by an exact elimination factorization `E·A = R` with `det E = 1` and first-column Laplace expansion of `R`), `higham9_1_firstSchurComplement_leadingSubmatrix_comm`, `higham9_1_leadingSubmatrix_det_eq_pivot_mul_schur` (leading-minor Schur identity), `higham9_1_lu_exists_of_leading_minors_ne_zero` (nonvanishing leading minors ⟹ exact LU certificate, induction through the Schur complement over `higham9_1_lu_exists_of_firstSchurComplement`), and `higham9_15_perturbed_lu_exists` (under Barrlund's smallness the whole path `A+t·ΔA` carries LU factorizations; combined with `higham9_15_perturbed_LUFactSpec_pivots_ne_zero` + `higham9_1_lu_unique_of_pivots_ne_zero` they are unique with nonzero pivots). Remaining for (9.15)/(9.27): continuity of the factors in `t` and the final assembly through `higham9_15_selfMajorant_path_small_branch`. Build PASS; all new declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-07 (same pass, continued): added the **pivot-continuity leg**: `higham9_15_leading_minor_path_continuous` (`t ↦ det B_k(A+t·ΔA)` is continuous, via `Continuous.matrix_det`), `higham9_15_pivot_ratio_path_continuousOn` (consecutive-minor ratios are `ContinuousOn` any set where the denominator minor is nonvanishing — supplied on `[0,1]` by `higham9_15_perturbed_leading_minor_ne_zero`), and `higham9_1_pivot_eq_leading_minor_ratio` (pivot = consecutive-minor ratio in any exact LU certificate, from `higham9_14_leadingSubmatrix_det_succ`). Hence the pivots of the unique factorization path `A+t·ΔA` are continuous in `t`. Remaining for (9.15)/(9.27): bordered-minor formulas for the off-diagonal `L`/`U` entries (same elimination/Laplace machinery), entry continuity, and the final assembly through `higham9_15_selfMajorant_path_small_branch`. Build PASS; all three declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-07 (same pass, continued): proved the **`U`-entry bordered-minor formula**: `higham9_15_leadingRows_mul_of_lower_left` (leading-rows block of `L·X` factors through the leading `L`-block for an arbitrary column selection), the bordered column selector `higham9_15_borderedCols` with its evaluation lemmas, `higham9_15_borderedU_det` (`det` of upper-triangular rows `0..k` at columns `0..k-1, j` is `(∏_{i<k} U_{ii})·U_{k,j}`), and `higham9_15_borderedMinor_eq_pivots_mul_U` (the bordered minor of `A` equals the pivot product times `U_{k,j}` in any exact LU certificate). Combined with `higham9_15_leading_minor_path_continuous`-style continuity of bordered minors and the nonvanishing pivot products along the Barrlund path, every `U`-entry of the factorization path is a continuous function of `t`. Remaining: the symmetric `L`-entry formula and the final assembly. Build PASS; all new declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-07 (same pass, continued): proved the symmetric **`L`-entry bordered-minor formula**: `higham9_15_leadingCols_mul_of_upper_right` (leading-columns block of `X·U` factors through the leading `U`-block for an arbitrary row selection), `higham9_15_borderedRows` with evaluation lemmas, `higham9_15_borderedL_det` (`det` of unit-lower rows `0..k-1, i` at columns `0..k` is `L_{i,k}`), and `higham9_15_borderedMinor_eq_L_mul_pivots` (bordered minor of `A` = `L_{i,k}` times the first `k+1` pivots). Both LU factor entries are now explicit minor ratios of `A`; along the Barrlund path the minors are continuous (`higham9_15_leading_minor_path_continuous`-style) and the pivot products nonvanishing, so the full factorization path is entrywise continuous in `t`. Remaining for (9.15)/(9.27): packaging entry continuity and the final assembly through `higham9_15_selfMajorant_path_small_branch`. Build PASS; all new declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-07 (same pass, continued): completed the **entry-continuity toolkit** for the Barrlund path: `higham9_15_minor_path_continuous` (any row/column-selected minor of `A+t·ΔA` is continuous in `t`), `higham9_15_U_entry_path_continuousOn` / `higham9_15_L_entry_path_continuousOn` (the bordered-minor/leading-minor ratio maps are `ContinuousOn` any set with nonvanishing leading minors — on `[0,1]` by `higham9_15_perturbed_leading_minor_ne_zero`), and `higham9_15_U_entry_eq_minor_ratio` / `higham9_15_L_entry_eq_minor_ratio` (these ratios are exactly the factor entries of any exact LU certificate when the leading minors are nonzero). Every ingredient of the (9.27) homotopy is now in place: existence+uniqueness+pivots of the path, entrywise continuity, the quadratic self-majorant, and the branch-selection lemma; what remains is the single assembly theorem stitching them together (a multi-lemma integration, next session). Build PASS; all five declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-07 (same pass, continued): added the **scaled-path certificates**: `higham9_15_opNorm2Le_smul_of_abs_le_one` (`opNorm2Le` is stable under scaling by `|t| ≤ 1`), `higham9_15_path_G_opNorm2Le` (`Linv·(t•ΔA)·Uinv` inherits the sub-unit certificate of `G` for `|t| ≤ 1`), and `higham9_15_path_lu_exists` (every `A + t·ΔA` on the homotopy path has an exact LU certificate, in the scaled form directly usable by the assembly). Build PASS; all three declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-07 (same pass, continued): constructed the **factorization path**: `higham9_15_pathL` / `higham9_15_pathU` (classical choice of the LU factors of `A + t·ΔA`), `higham9_15_pathLU_spec(_of_barrlund)` (they form an exact certificate along the path), `higham9_15_pathU_pivots_ne_zero` (path pivots nonzero), `higham9_15_pathLU_unique` (any certificate coincides with the path factors — the path is well-defined), and `higham9_15_pathLU_zero` (`t = 0` recovers `L`, `U`). Together with the entry-ratio identities the path factors are entrywise continuous on `[-1, 1]`. Remaining for the assembly: `s(t)` packaging, the pointwise quadratic self-majorant via the `normalized_G` split lemmas, and the endpoint bound through `higham9_15_selfMajorant_path_small_branch`. Build PASS; all new declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-07 (same pass, continued): proved the **pointwise quadratic self-majorant along the path**: defined `higham9_15_pathS` (`s(t) = ‖L⁻¹(L(t)−L) + (U(t)−U)U⁻¹‖_F` for the chosen factorization path), `higham9_15_pathS_zero` (`s(0)=0`), `higham9_15_frobNormRect_smul`, and `higham9_15_pathS_selfMajorant` (`s(t) ≤ ‖L⁻¹ΔAU⁻¹‖_F + s(t)²` for `t ∈ [0,1]`, via the normalized factorization identity `1+G(t) = (1+X)(1+Y)`, the triangular-support lemma with the honest `hLinv_lower`/`hUinv_upper` inverse-shape hypotheses, the stril/triu split Pythagoras, and Frobenius submultiplicativity). Remaining for the rigorous (9.27)-type endpoint: continuity of `s` on `[0,1]` (entries of the path factors are minor ratios; `s` is a finite sqrt-of-sum-of-squares composition) and the final endpoint theorem through `higham9_15_selfMajorant_path_small_branch`. Build PASS; all new declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-07 (same pass, continued): **completed the Barrlund homotopy assembly — the rigorous LU perturbation endpoint bound.** Added `higham9_15_pathL_entry_continuousOn` / `higham9_15_pathU_entry_continuousOn` (every entry of the factorization path is continuous on `[0,1]`, by `ContinuousOn.congr` with the minor-ratio maps), `higham9_15_pathS_continuousOn` (`s` is continuous — sqrt of a finite sum of squares of continuous entries), `higham9_15_rigorous_pathS_endpoint_bound` (`s(1) ≤ (1−√(1−4‖G‖_F))/2` via the branch-selection lemma), and the source-facing `higham9_15_rigorous_lu_perturbation_combined_bound` (any exact LU certificate of `A+ΔA` coincides with the path endpoint by uniqueness and inherits the bound). Hypotheses of record: `L·U = A` with triangular shapes, inverse certificates `Linv·L = 1`, `U·Uinv = 1` with their triangular shapes, nonzero pivots, `opNorm2Le G c` with `c < 1`, and `‖G‖_F < 1/4`. This closes the rigorous quadratic-form variant of (9.27); the not-proved ledger keeps the row OPEN for the exact book form (`‖G‖_F/(1−‖G‖₂)` under `‖G‖₂ < 1` alone), whose remaining gap is Barrlund's min-factor control. Build PASS; all new declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-07 (Claude Split-2, web-authorized paper pass): with Max's renewed authorization I re-attempted acquisition of the three citation-blocked proofs. Foster (1997, JCAM 86) is flagged open-access by the Semantic Scholar API but ScienceDirect returns 403 to every programmatic route (browser-UA + open-archive `pdfft` endpoint, cookie jar); the arXiv surveys (Bisain-Edelman-Urschel 2303.04892 §1.4, eq. (1.2)) only *state* Foster's bound `g ≤ (3/2)n^{(3/4)ln n}` and cite Foster [12] for the proof, which is reproduced in no accessible source. Barrlund (1991, BIT) and Bohte (1975) remain paywalled. These three rows stay allowed-BLOCKED (cited proof unavailable, no honest local route). **Value recovered from the accessible literature:** the open Li-Wei paper (arXiv:1405.0179, Thm 3.1) confirms the rigorous LU perturbation bound has exactly the small-root quadratic shape `2‖Y‖δ/(1+√(1-4‖Y_U‖‖Y_L‖δ)) = (1-√(1-4·))/2`, i.e. my `higham9_15_rigorous_lu_perturbation_combined_bound` is the same literature-grade result. Using this I proved `higham9_15_rigorous_lu_perturbation_split_bounds`: the two normalized factor perturbations are *individually* bounded, `‖L⁻¹(L'-L)‖_F ≤ (1-√(1-4‖G‖_F))/2` and `‖(U'-U)U⁻¹‖_F ≤ (1-√(1-4‖G‖_F))/2` (the shape of Higham's displayed componentwise (9.27)), via the strict-lower/upper triangularity of the two normalized perturbations and the stril/triu Frobenius split of the combined bound. Build PASS; axiom-clean. The exact book form (`‖G‖_F/(1-‖G‖₂)` under `‖G‖₂<1` alone) still needs Barrlund's min-factor argument and stays OPEN.
  - 2026-07-07 (Max delivered Barrlund 1991 + Foster 1997 PDFs): **closed the exact Barrlund (9.27) normwise form (Theorem 9.15)** — previously only the rigorous `‖G‖_F<1/4` variant. With the paper in hand, Barrlund's Theorem 3.1 is fully elementary. Added the bridge `higham9_15_matMul_eq_rectMatMul` and the two Frobenius/spectral helpers `higham9_15_frobNormRect_matMul_le_of_rectOpNorm2Le` (`‖AB‖_F ≤ ‖A‖₂‖B‖_F`) and `..._of_transpose_rectOpNorm2Le` (`‖BC‖_F ≤ ‖B‖_F‖C‖₂`), then `higham9_15_barrlund_deltaL_bound` and `higham9_15_barrlund_deltaU_bound`: for `A=LU`, `A+ΔA=(L+ΔL)(U+ΔU)` with inverse certificates and `‖G‖₂<1` (`G=L⁻¹ΔA U⁻¹`), `‖ΔL‖_F ≤ ‖L‖₂‖G‖_F/(1−‖G‖₂)` and `‖ΔU‖_F ≤ ‖U‖₂‖G‖_F/(1−‖G‖₂)`. Proof via the exact-factorization split (3.4)-(3.5), the strictly-lower/upper triangular projection (reusing the `stril`/`triu` machinery), the resolvent identity, and Frobenius submultiplicativity. Both axiom-clean; target build PASS. This is the literal displayed (9.27). Foster (9.16) proof also read (Hadamard-subset + implicit-`s_k` optimization + calculus); subset-Hadamard core is the next increment. Bohte (9.11) still not located.

  - 2026-07-09 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): **proved Foster's Theorem 3 tail bound `s_n ≤ (3/2)·ln n/n` for `n ≥ 31`, fully derivative-free.** Foster's proof differentiates his implicit `p_n(x)` and asserts a computation at `n = 18`; the formalization replaces this with: the drift term `higham9_16_fosterG n = (3 ln n + 4.5 ln²n)/(2n)` shown discretely nonincreasing (`ln(1+1/n) ≤ 1/n` + a quadratic comparison), a single rational-certified endpoint (`higham9_16_t3_endpoint`, using `3.43 ≤ ln 31 ≤ 3.435` from `log_two` bounds and `ln(ln 31) ≥ 2 − e/3.43` from `exp_one` bounds), and the assembly `higham9_16_fosterS_le_tail`: the stage value at `x₀ = (3/2)ln n/n` dominates `C_n` via `x₀(1+x₀)^{n−1} ≥ x₀e^{(n−1)x₀/(1+x₀)} ≥ (3L/2)e^{L/2−G(n)} ≥ e^{L/2+1/2} ≥ C_n`.

(9.16) is Foster's Theorem 3** (`t_n ≤ 1.5·n^{(3/4)ln n}`). Build PASS; all 3 audited declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-09 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): **PROVED FOSTER'S LEMMA 2 IN FULL.** `higham9_16_fosterA2` (Lemma A.2, the master strong induction: the head of any (A.2)-(A.4)-feasible tuple is at most the band value `M(k, C, P)` — case 1 via `fosterA2_step_case1`, case 2 via `case2_reduction` + the sharpened-constant induction hypothesis + `hat_compose` + the global tail antitonicity) and `higham9_16_foster_lemma2` (`p_1 ≤ t_n` at the chapter constant `sqrt(n^n)` with zero tail, via `M(n, sqrt(n^n), 0) = t_n`). This closes the constrained-optimization heart of eq. (9.16) — previously classified as research-grade. With `higham9_16_fosterFeasible_of_rook`, the rook-pivoting growth bound `ρ_n ≤ t_n` is now within pure-assembly reach; the remaining open mathematics for (9.16) is only Foster's Theorem 3 calculus estimate `t_n ≤ 1.5·n^{(3/4)ln n}`. Also repaired a cross-split breakage in `examples/LibraryLookup.lean` (missing `import ...QR.Higham19Thm6Pivoted` for a Wave-13 check added remotely). Build PASS; all 4 audited declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-09 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): **proved the GLOBAL tail antitonicity of Foster's band value function — the (A.17) program is complete.** `higham9_16_fosterBandIdx_filter_eq`/`_spec` (with A.3 the band filter is the initial segment `Icc 1 j`, giving the two-sided membership `q^(j) < P ≤ q^(j+1)`), `higham9_16_fosterBandIdx_at_root` (`bandIdx(q^(j+1)) = j`), `higham9_16_fosterBandValue_at_root` (the value at an if-band edge in closed form, via `fosterPStar_eq_at_edge` — the tail-iffs and `at_edge` generalized to `j ≥ 0` en route, and `glue_last` relaxed to `K ≥ 2`), and the main theorem `higham9_16_fosterBandValue_antitone` (`M(K,C,t) ≤ M(K,C,P)` for `0 ≤ P ≤ t` — strong induction on the band index of `t`: same-band by the derivative-free in-band lemma or the (A.8) formula directly, lower-band by descending through the left edge with the gluing equations and the induction hypothesis). Everything Foster's Lemma A.2 needs is now proved; what remains is the master strong induction itself (pure assembly of `fosterA2_step_case1`, `case2_reduction`, `hat_compose`, and this antitonicity), then Lemma 2 as its `P = 0` instance. Build PASS; all 5 audited declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-09 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): **proved the band-formula gluing equations.** `higham9_16_fosterQ_mono_stage` (band roots monotone in the stage, chained from A.3), `higham9_16_fosterPStar_eq_at_edge` (`p*_j(q^(j+1)) = q^(j+1)` from the two in-band iffs by antisymmetry), `higham9_16_band_formula_glue` (adjacent if-band formulas agree at their shared edge — combining `fosterPStar_at_edge`, now generalized to `j ≥ 0` so it covers the band-0→1 edge, with `fosterT_succ`), and `higham9_16_band_formula_glue_last` (the band-(K-2) formula meets the (A.8) value `C/e^(K-1)` at the last edge, from the defining relation of `q^(K-1)` whose stage constant is `sqrt(1^1) = 1`). Together with the in-band antitonicity these give the global tail monotonicity of the band value by chaining. Build PASS; all 5 audited declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-08 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): **proved the band-edge gluing gadgets.** The mirrored comparison lemmas `higham9_16_fosterQ_le_iff`, `higham9_16_fosterPStar_le_iff`, and `higham9_16_fosterPStar_le_tail_iff` (`p*(P) ≤ P ↔ q^(j+1) ≤ P`; with the earlier direction this pins `p*(edge) = edge`), `higham9_16_fosterBandIdx_mono`, and the key edge value `higham9_16_fosterPStar_at_edge` (at `e = q^(j+1)` the band-`(j+1)` shifted root equals `s_(K-j-1)·(1+(j+1)e)` — proved by the σ-substitution `p = σ·a` which turns the (A.6) equation at the edge into the `s`-stage equation, closed by `fosterS` uniqueness and the defining relation of `e`). These are exactly the inputs for gluing adjacent band formulas at their shared edge (`A_j = A_(j+1)(1+s)` via `fosterT_succ`). Build PASS; all 5 audited declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-08 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): **proved Foster's (A.17) in-band value monotonicity, derivative-free.** `higham9_16_fosterBandValue_inband_antitone`: within a band (`Pᵢ ≤ p*(Pᵢ)` as hypotheses of record), the (A.7) value `1+jP+p*(P)` is antitone in the tail `P` — Foster's implicit-differentiation step replaced by the division chain on the defining relations plus a two-zone case split closed by `higham9_16_phi_strictMono` (zone 1) and `higham9_16_phi_le_peak` (zone 2). With this, ALL analytically hard content of Lemma A.2 is formalized; the remaining work (edge gluing across bands, the global antitone chain, and the master strong induction assembling case 1 / case 2 through `hat_compose`) is mechanical. Build PASS; the audited declaration is axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-08 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): **built the derivative-free (A.17)-replacement toolkit.** Foster proves the in-band value monotonicity by implicit differentiation (his (A.17)); the formalization replaces this entirely with: `higham9_16_pow_sub_pow_ge` (discrete convexity `y^j − x^j ≥ j·x^(j-1)(y−x)` via the geometric-sum identity), `higham9_16_phi_strictMono` (the profile `(a−jx)x^j` is strictly increasing on `[0, a/(j+1)]` — the zone-1 argument, with the peak value `(a/(j+1))^(j+1)`), `higham9_16_phi_le_peak` (the AM-GM instance `p·x^j ≤ ((jx+p)/(j+1))^(j+1)` as a corollary), `higham9_16_le_fosterPStar_iff`, and the clean in-band characterization `higham9_16_fosterPStar_ge_tail_iff` (`P ≤ p*(P) ↔ P ≤ q^(j+1)` — the (A.6) shifted stage at `P` times `P^j` is exactly the stage-`(j+1)` value at `P`). What remains for Lemma A.2 is now purely mechanical: the in-band value monotonicity from these gadgets (division chain + two zones), edge gluing, and the master induction. Build PASS; all 5 audited declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-08 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): **assembled Foster's (A.14)-(A.16) in full — the band-value composition.** `higham9_16_fosterBandValue_hat_compose`: for any case-2 tail (`q^(1) < t`, `k ≥ 1`), `(1+t)·M(k, C/(t(1+t)^k), t/(1+t)) = M(k+1, C, t)` — the if-branches align via `higham9_16_fosterBandIdx_hat` (the level indices differ by exactly one, so the `fosterT` prefixes agree since `(k+1)-(ĵ+1)-1 = k-ĵ-1`), the shifted roots compose via `higham9_16_fosterPStar_scale` and the Möbius shift, and the (A.8) else-branches collapse by the same `(1+t)`-exponent bookkeeping. With this, the case-2 slice value IS the next band's value; the only remaining ingredient for the full Lemma A.2 induction is the tail monotonicity of `fosterBandValue` (the AM-GM two-zone argument in the design packet). Build PASS; the audited declaration is axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-08 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): **proved the algebraic core of Foster's (A.14)-(A.16) — the `p*` scaling identity.** `higham9_16_fosterPStar_scale`: the level-`k` shifted root at the hatted data `(1+(j-1)t̂, Ĉ/t̂^(j-1))`, scaled by `1+t`, equals the level-`(k+1)` shifted root at `(1+jt, C/t^j)` — by `fosterPStar` uniqueness, the Möbius shift identity `(1+t)(1+(j-1)t̂) = 1+jt`, and the exponent collapse `(j-1)+(m+1) = j+m`. This is the identity behind Foster's claim that the case-2 slice value composes into the next band's formula. Remaining for Lemma A.2: the band-value composition wrapper (`(1+t)·M(k,Ĉ,t̂) = M(k+1,C,t)`, an if-branch analysis over `higham9_16_fosterBandIdx_hat` using this identity), tail monotonicity, and the master induction. Build PASS; the audited declaration is axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-08 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): **proved Foster's (A.12) — the band-membership transfer — in all three forms.** `higham9_16_le_fosterQ_iff` (root comparison = stage-value comparison), `higham9_16_fosterQ_le_iff_hat_le` and `higham9_16_fosterQ_lt_iff_hat_lt` (`t ≤ q^(r+1)` at level `k+1` iff `t/(1+t) ≤ q̂^(r)` at level `k` with the hatted constant `C/(t(1+t)^k)` — an immediate consequence of the hat-transfer identity, much shorter than Foster's (A.13) computation), and the band-index form `higham9_16_fosterBandIdx_hat` (for a case-2 tail, the level-`(k+1)` band index equals the hatted level-`k` index plus one — by an explicit `Finset` bijection `r ↦ r+1`). Remaining for Lemma A.2: the (A.14)-(A.16) composition of band formulas and the tail monotonicity of the band value. Build PASS; all 4 audited declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-08 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): **assembled the full case-1 step of the Lemma A.2 induction against the band value function.** `higham9_16_fosterBandValue_one` (`M(1,C,P) = C` — the base-case value), `higham9_16_fosterQ_one_le` (with A.3, the first band root is the least), `higham9_16_fosterBandIdx_eq_zero_of_le_first`, and `higham9_16_fosterA2_step_case1` (case 1 of the step now concludes `p_1 ≤ fosterBandValue (k+1) C P` — the exact inductive target — since a case-1 tail forces the band index to vanish). Remaining for Lemma A.2: the case-2 half ((A.12) band transfer, (A.14)-(A.16) composition, tail monotonicity of the band value — exact statements recorded in the design packet). Build PASS; all 4 audited declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-08 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): **proved Foster's Lemma A.3 — the general band-root interlacing — in full.** `higham9_16_fosterQ_lt_succ`: for `2 ≤ k`, `0 < C ≤ sqrt(k^k)`, and `1 ≤ r`, `r+1 ≤ k`, the (A.5) roots satisfy `q^(r) < q^(r+1)` (Foster's (A.18) chain `q_(k+1) < q_k < ⋯ < q_1`). The proof follows Foster's double induction (outer on the level `k`, inner on the stage `r`) with the base step `higham9_16_fosterQ_one_lt_two` and the new gadgets: `higham9_16_fosterQStage_hat_transfer` (the (A.22)/(A.25) level-shift identity `QStage_k^(r+1)(x) = QStage_(k-1)^r(x/(1+x))·x(1+x)^(k-1)`), `higham9_16_fosterQ_hat` (hat image of a root is the hatted-constant root one level down), the hatted-constant bound `Chat < sqrt((k-1)^(k-1))` extracted from the stage-1 relation and `fosterStage` strict monotonicity, and `higham9_16_hat_strictMonoOn`; the two Foster cases (`w̃ < q̂` via stage monotonicity and `h` antitone; `q̂ ≤ w̃` via the outer induction hypothesis) close exactly as in the paper, with no derivatives anywhere. With A.3 done, the A.2 band structure is fully ordered; remaining for Lemma 2: the case-2 value comparison, then Theorem 3 and assembly. Build PASS; all 4 audited declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-08 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): **proved the case-1 half of Foster's Lemma A.2 induction step.** `higham9_16_fosterA2_case1_slice`: whenever the last free variable `t` satisfies the case-1 condition `sqrt(k^k)·t(1+t)^k ≤ C` (equivalently `t ≤ fosterQ (k+1) 1 C` by `higham9_16_case1_iff`), the head of any feasible `(k+1)`-tuple is bounded by the band-1 value `V(k+1, C)` — assuming only the `k`-level standard-constant bound (`p'_1 ≤ t_k`), which the eventual induction supplies; the proof composes `rescale_std`, the head reassembly, and the case-1 boundary. `higham9_16_fosterA2_case2_reduction`: for `t > 0`, the rescaled tuple is feasible at the sharpened constant `min(sqrt(k^k), C/(t(1+t)^k))` — the exact case-2 input. Remaining for Lemma A.2: the case-2 value comparison ((A.14)-(A.16) composition + the derivative-free band monotonicity from the design packet) and the A.3 general interlacing. Build PASS; both audited declarations axiom-clean.
  - 2026-07-08 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass, continued): **connected the rook factorization to Lemma A.2 and closed its base case.** `higham9_16_fosterFeasible_of_rook` (the sorted pivot magnitudes of a normalized rook LU factorization form a Lemma A.2-feasible tuple at the chapter constant `sqrt(n^n)` with zero tail — the full product bound extracted from the `h = n` nested constraint), `higham9_16_fosterA2_one` (the `k = 1` base case of Lemma A.2), and `higham9_16_fosterFeasible_head_max`. With this, eq. (9.16) reduces exactly to: (i) the A.2 induction `p_1 ≤ fosterBandValue k C P` (whose value function and rescaling transforms are already in place), and (ii) Theorem 3 (`t_n ≤ 1.5 n^{(3/4)ln n}`).

New imports: `Mathlib.Data.Fin.Tuple.Sort`, `Mathlib.Order.Interval.Finset.Nat`. `lake build NumStability.Algorithms.HighamChapter9` PASS (3045 jobs); `#print axioms` for all 13 audited new declarations `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
  - 2026-07-08 (Claude Split-2 proof-completion pass): **closed the Theorem 9.11 `p = 1` case — tridiagonal GEPP growth `rho <= 2` — unconditionally at the exact-trace level.** Added the band-tracked active-stage invariant `higham9_11_TridiagActiveBound` (active matrix tridiagonal, corner entry `<= 2M`, all other entries `<= M`), the pivot-locality lemma `higham9_11_tridiag_pivot_val_le_one` (a nonzero tridiagonal first-column pivot lies in the first two rows), the one-step preservation theorem `higham9_11_tridiagActive_schur_preserved` (a partial-pivoting elimination step preserves the `(2M, M)` profile — the "easily verified" band-fill bookkeeping of the Bohte `p = 1` case, done by explicit case analysis on the swap/no-swap fill-in), the trace induction `higham9_11_tridiag_PartialPivotGEPPUTrace_entry_abs_le_two_mul`, and the source-facing theorems `higham9_11_tridiag_GEPPUTrace_entry_abs_le_two_mul`, `higham9_11_tridiag_GEPPUTrace_growthFactorEntry_le_two` (`rho <= 2`, Definition 9.6 max-entry form), `higham9_11_tridiag_GEPPUTrace_growthFactorEntry_le_bohteBound` (stated with the Bohte scalar `higham9_11_bohteBound 1`), and the Theorem 9.5 solve endpoint `higham9_11_tridiag_wilkinson_source_bound_of_PartialPivotGEPPUTrace` (`rho = 2` Wilkinson normwise backward-error bound for tridiagonal GEPP solves). `lake build NumStability.Algorithms.HighamChapter9` PASS (3045 jobs); `#print axioms` for all eight new declarations reported only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; `git diff --check` clean. The Theorem 9.11 row remains OPEN only for the general-`p >= 2` Bohte constant (citation-blocked).
  - 2026-07-07 (Foster [435,1997] delivered, continued): formalized the **analytic core of Foster's Theorem 1** — the subset-Hadamard pivot inequality (his eq. (9)) — as `higham9_16_foster_subset_hadamard`: for a rook LU factorization `A=LU` normalized to `max|aᵢⱼ|≤1` with the rook bounds `|ℓᵢⱼ|≤1`, `|uᵢⱼ|≤|uᵢᵢ|`, every subset `I` (|I|=h, J=Iᶜ) satisfies `∏_{i∈I}|uᵢᵢ| ≤ √(hʰ)·(1+∑_{j∈J}|uⱼⱼ|)ʰ`. Proof: the `I×I` block of `B=∑_{i∈I}ℓᵢuᵢ` factors as `L_{II}U_{II}` via the monotone enumeration `Finset.orderEmbOfFin` (block-triangular det = `∏_{i∈I}uᵢᵢ`), its entries are bounded by `1+∑_{j∈J}|uⱼⱼ|` (the discarded `J`-part, from `A=LU` and the rook bounds), and `higham9_hadamard_det_sq_le_pow_maxEntryNorm` closes it. This is the cited Hadamard "key tool" Foster's Theorem 1 rests on. Remaining for the full (9.16) bound `ρ ≤ 1.5 n^{(3/4)ln n}`: the nested-subset constraints (eq. 10), Lemma 2's constrained optimization (the appendix double-induction over the implicit sequence `sₖ`), and Theorem 3's calculus estimate — the genuinely multi-session tail, now source-in-hand. Target build PASS; axiom-clean.

## Chapter completion assessment (2026-07-07; superseded by the M25/M28 closures — final state: gate PASS, no residuals)

**All 14 primary labels (Thms 9.1, 9.3-9.5, 9.8-9.15, Lemma 9.6, Alg 9.2) and
the numbered-equation families (9.1)-(9.27) have proved source-facing Lean
declarations,** with the following exactly-characterized residuals where the
book's *only* justification is an external citation Higham does not prove and
whose source is inaccessible despite exhaustive authorized acquisition
attempts (ScienceDirect direct + open-archive `pdfft` with browser UA/cookies,
Semantic Scholar API, fatcat/scholar.archive.org, arXiv restatement surveys,
web.archive.org — all 403/blocked/DNS-fail or state-only). These are the
allowed-BLOCKED terminal residuals (both since CLOSED: (9.16) at M25, Thm 9.11 at M28):

1. **Eq. (9.16), Foster rook-pivoting bound** `ρₙ ≤ (3/2)·n^{(3/4)ln n}`
   (Foster [435, 1997]; Higham gives no proof). The open arXiv survey
   Bisain-Edelman-Urschel (2303.04892, eq. (1.2)) only *states* it, citing
   Foster [12]; no accessible source reproduces the proof. Proved honest
   surface: the general finite-arithmetic `2^{n-1}` bound (survey eq. (4.1),
   holds for all pivoting) via the rook/complete-pivoting bridges. Residual:
   the sub-exponential constant — cited-proof-unavailable.
2. **Theorem 9.11, Bohte banded bound** `ρₙᵖ ≤ 2^{2p-1}-(p-1)2^{p-2}` (Bohte
   [146, 1975]; Higham: "See Bohte"). Proved: the bound *formula*
   (`higham9_11_bohteBound`, with p=1↦2, p=2↦7 specializations matching the
   book) and conditional banded/tridiagonal solve wrappers; the SPD-tridiagonal
   sub-case is proved unconditionally (`higham9_12_spd_tridiag_growthFactorEntry
   _le_one`, ρ≤1). Residual: the general-p growth constant — cited-proof-
   unavailable. **Concrete accessible next target** (not citation-blocked, but
   a genuine multi-lemma band-fill induction Higham calls "easily verified"):
   the p=1 general-tridiagonal GEPP bound `growthFactorEntry ≤ 2`, via a
   tridiagonal partial-pivoting GE trace with band tracking discharging the
   `hGrowth` hypothesis of `higham9_11_tridiagonal_bohte_solve_tight_of_growth_le`.
3. **Theorem 9.15, exact Barrlund normwise form (9.27)** — **CLOSED
   (2026-07-07, Barrlund [90, 1991] delivered by Max).** With the source in
   hand, Barrlund's Theorem 3.1 proof turned out to be fully elementary (no
   homotopy, no min-factor control, no integrals). Formalized exactly for both
   factors: `higham9_15_barrlund_deltaL_bound`
   (`‖ΔL‖_F ≤ ‖L‖₂·‖G‖_F/(1−‖G‖₂)`) and `higham9_15_barrlund_deltaU_bound`
   (`‖ΔU‖_F ≤ ‖U‖₂·‖G‖_F/(1−‖G‖₂)`), `G = L⁻¹ΔA U⁻¹`, under `‖G‖₂ < 1` — i.e.
   `max{‖ΔL‖_F/‖L‖₂, ‖ΔU‖_F/‖U‖₂} ≤ ‖G‖_F/(1−‖G‖₂)`, the displayed (9.27).
   Proof: the exact factorization gives
   `L⁻¹ΔL + ΔU(U+ΔU)⁻¹ = L⁻¹ΔA(U+ΔU)⁻¹` (resp. the left-inverse mirror); the
   strictly-lower / upper triangular split isolates each factor; the resolvent
   identity `(U+ΔU)⁻¹ = U⁻¹ − U⁻¹ΔU(U+ΔU)⁻¹` plus Frobenius/spectral
   submultiplicativity closes the scalar inequality. Spectral norms enter as
   `rectOpNorm2Le` bound-parameters; instantiating at `opNorm2Le_opNorm2`
   recovers the literal operator-norm statement. The earlier homotopy variant
   (`higham9_15_rigorous_lu_perturbation_combined_bound` / `_split_bounds`,
   valid under `‖G‖_F < 1/4`) remains as an independent proved surface.

## Open issues
SUPERSEDED (2026-07-09): both residuals below were subsequently closed — (9.16) at M25, Thm 9.11 at M28 — and the gate is PASS. Historical text follows:
- **Eq. (9.16), Foster rook bound** — source PDF now delivered (Max, 2026-07-07);
  reclassified from citation-blocked to *source-in-hand, formalization in
  progress*. Foster's proof (Thm 1 + Lemma 2 + Thm 3) is a genuine multi-part
  argument: a subset-Hadamard determinant inequality, a constrained optimization
  over an implicitly-defined sequence `s_k` (root of `s(1+s)^{k-1} =
  k^{k/2}/(k-1)^{(k-1)/2}`), and a calculus estimate `t_n ≤ 1.5 n^{(3/4)ln n}`.
  Progress so far (2026-07-07/08): the subset-Hadamard core (Foster Thm 1,
  eq. (9)) is PROVED (`higham9_16_foster_subset_hadamard`); the sorted nested
  constraints (Foster eq. (10)) are PROVED
  (`higham9_16_foster_nested_constraints`,
  `higham9_16_foster_sorted_constraints`, via
  `higham9_16_exists_antitone_enumeration`); the implicit stage-root
  foundation for Foster eq. (6)/(7) is BUILT (`higham9_16_fosterS` — the
  unique positive root of `s(1+s)^{k-1} = C_k`, existence/uniqueness by
  IVT + strict monotonicity — and the bound `higham9_16_fosterT`
  `t_n = s_1(1+s_2)⋯(1+s_n)` with positivity/recurrence lemmas).
  Further progress (2026-07-08, same pass): Foster Lemma A.1 is proved
  derivative-free (`higham9_16_fosterS_succ_lt` via Bernoulli), the (A.5)
  band-root layer is built (`higham9_16_fosterQ*` with the (A.5)-(6) link and
  Möbius identity), the Lemma A.3 base interlacing is proved
  (`higham9_16_fosterQ_one_lt_two` via the ratio identity
  `higham9_16_fosterQStage_succ_mul_const`), and the Lemma A.2 feasibility
  predicate with both rescaling transforms is proved
  (`higham9_16_FosterFeasible`, `higham9_16_fosterFeasible_rescale_std/_prod`).
  Remaining: the A.3 general interlacing, the A.2 band value function and
  induction (a complete derivative-free proof design replacing Foster's
  implicit differentiation (A.17) with a two-zone polynomial argument +
  weighted AM-GM is recorded in
  `chapter_splitting/proof_packets/ch9_16_foster_lemma2_design.md`, local-only,
  together with draft Lean for the (A.6) shifted-root gadget and band value
  function), Theorem 3 (the calculus estimate `t_n ≤ 1.5 n^{(3/4)ln n}`), and
  the assembly onto the rook trace. These remain research-grade multi-session
  pieces.
- **Thm 9.11, Bohte banded general-`p` constant** — still citation-blocked
  (Bohte 1975 not located) for `p >= 2`. The formula, conditional wrappers, the
  unconditional SPD-tridiagonal sub-case, and now (2026-07-08) **the full
  `p = 1` general-tridiagonal GEPP bound `ρ ≤ 2`**
  (`higham9_11_tridiag_GEPPUTrace_growthFactorEntry_le_two`) are proved; the
  residual is exactly the general-`p >= 2` growth constant whose only source is
  the unavailable Bohte paper.

Eq. (9.14) is CLOSED from the actual recursive GECP trace, both for the
exposed `U` entries and for the source definition's maximum over every reduced
matrix;
Theorem 9.1 existence-from-minors,
the exact Barrlund (9.27) normwise form (Thm 9.15), and the rigorous
quadratic-form variant are all CLOSED. No `sorry`, `admit`, or new `axiom` is
used anywhere in the chapter; open rows are kept honest as partial/conditional
surfaces rather than closed by assuming their conclusions.

- **M24 (Split 2, session claude-ch09-split2-20260708181608)**: (9.16) Foster Theorem 3 head numerics, part 1 of 2.
  Added the rational bracket criterion `higham9_16_fosterS_le_of_sq_cert` (squared, denominator-free, `norm_num`-decidable)
  plus machine-generated certified brackets `higham9_16_fosterS_le_3..30` (4-decimal rationals) and the chained
  product bounds `higham9_16_fosterT_le_2..30`. Worst certified margin vs `1.5·e^{(3/4)ln²n}` is 2.96% at `n = 3`
  (exact-rational verification in the generator). Axiom-clean; full chapter rebuild green (3045 jobs).

- **M25 (Split 2, session claude-ch09-split2-20260708181608)**: **(9.16) CLOSED.** Foster Theorem 3 head numerics part 2:
  certified rational lower bounds on `ln p` for the ten primes `p <= 29` (near-powers-of-2 with the `[x/(1+x), x]`
  log bracket, e.g. `3ln5 = 7ln2 − ln(128/125)`), composite bounds `ln n` for `n <= 30`, symbolic Taylor partial-sum
  lemmas (degrees 3–8), and the 30 per-`n` comparisons `t_n <= (3/2)e^((3/4)ln²n)` (machine-generated; all margins
  verified exactly in the generator, worst 1.02% at `n = 3`). Assembled `higham9_16_fosterT_le_exp` (all `n >= 1`,
  telescoping induction from the discharged `n = 30` base) and the final theorem
  `higham9_16_RookPivotGEUTrace_growthFactorEntry_le_fosterBound`:
  `growthFactorEntry <= higham9_16_rookPivotFosterBound n = (3/2)·n^((3/4)·ln n)` — Foster [435, 1997] Theorems 1+3
  formalized end-to-end, fully derivative-free. Axiom-clean.

- **M26 (Split 2, session claude-ch09-split2-20260708181608)**: Theorem 9.11 general bandwidth `p` — the leading term
  `rho <= 2^(2p-1)` of Bohte's growth bound proved unconditionally (Bohte [146, 1975] remains paywalled; PDF requested).
  New band-tracked active-stage invariant `higham9_11_BandActiveBound` (5 clauses: preserved lower band, window
  support `<= 2p`, per-column fill profile `M·2^(2p-1-j)`, at-most-one-nonzero extreme window column, untouched
  original rows below the pivot window); one-step preservation `higham9_11_bandActive_schur_preserved`; trace
  induction to `higham9_11_banded_GEPPUTrace_growthFactorEntry_le_two_pow`. Key observation: the first stage touching
  a column cannot grow it (the pivot window meets that column in at most one nonzero). At `p = 1` this recovers the
  sharp tridiagonal constant `2` (`..._le_bohteBound_one`). Residual for the printed sharp constant: only the
  correction term `-(p-1)·2^(p-2)`, precisely recorded by `higham9_11_bohteBound_le_two_pow`.

- **M27 (Split 2, session claude-ch09-split2-20260708181608)**: Theorem 9.11 "almost attainable when n = 2p+1" —
  Higham's explicit 9x9, p = 4 example formalized at the concrete perturbation `eps = 1/1024`: exact machine-generated
  stage tables for all 8 Schur complements, per-stage pivot-choice certificates (rows 1/5 interchange at stage 1 only,
  matching the text), the explicit trace `higham9_11_bohteExample_trace_explicit`, trailing `U` entry exactly
  `118792/1025` (the printed `116 + O(eps)`), and the growth lower bound `>= 115 = bohteBound 4 - 1`
  (`higham9_11_bohte_example_growth_ge_bohteBound_sub_one`). Together with M26's unconditional upper bound
  `2^(2p-1) = 128`, the example brackets the sharp constant: `115 <= rho_max(9,4) <= 128`, with Bohte's printed
  `116` inside the bracket. Axiom-clean.

- **M28 (Split 2, session claude-ch09-split2-20260708181608)**: **Theorem 9.11 CLOSED** (source obtained: Bohte
  [146, 1975], IMA J. Appl. Math. 16(2):133-142, provided by Max via institutional access). Formalized Bohte's §5
  sharp growth analysis end-to-end: the comparison matrix `B` (eq. (9)) as `higham9_11_bohteBaux` (recursing on
  distance from the last column), all of Lemma 7 (entries >= 1, first-row domination via row-antitonicity, corner
  maximality, regime-1 doubling, diagonal unfolding into first-row sums, regime-2 closed form
  `c(p+u) = 2^(p+u) - u·2^(u-1)` via a two-regime strong induction with geometric-sum identities), the corner value
  `b(1,1) = 2^(2p-1) - (p-1)·2^(p-2) = higham9_11_bohteBound p`, the sharp per-entry invariant
  `higham9_11_BandActiveBoundSharp` with its one-step preservation (the journal paper defers this induction to
  Bohte's 1974 report; reconstructed here — the displaced-row swap case closes against the `B`-recurrence with
  equality, all other window rows via first-row domination), and the final theorem
  `higham9_11_banded_GEPPUTrace_growthFactorEntry_le_bohteBound`: banded GEPP growth
  `<= 2^(2p-1) - (p-1)·2^(p-2)`, independent of `n`. With M27's near-attainability witness (>= 115 at `n = 9`,
  `p = 4` vs bound 116), both claims of the printed theorem are discharged. Axiom-clean.
