## Source and Scope

- Edition: Higham, *Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms*, 2nd ed. (SIAM, 2002).
- Chapter: 5, "Polynomials" (book pp. 93–104).
- Source of truth for the fresh repair audit: rendered/reference PDF
  `References/1.9780898718027.ch5.pdf` (full-chapter read).
- Mode: core.
- Split ownership: pre-split foundational chapter (Chapters 1–6 band); audited from the Split 3B/4 worktree
  (`formalize/split4-claude`, worktree `ch18-split3-claude-claude-ch18-split3-20260703044646`).
- Main Lean files: `NumStability/Algorithms/Horner.lean`, the source-facing
  closure module `NumStability/Algorithms/Ch5SourceClosure.lean`, and
  `NumStability/Algorithms/Higham5PatersonStockmeyer.lean`.
- Audit date: 2026-07-22 (original strict repair 2026-07-18). Audit type:
  strict statement-level, PDF-first source verification and repair.
- Axiom spot-check (9 load-bearing decls, throwaway `#print axioms`, deleted after): all
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` — axiom-clean. Checked:
  `fl_hornerDesc_backward_error_coefficients`, `fl_hornerDesc_forward_error_bound`,
  `fl_hornerDesc_running_error_bound_of_inverseLocal`,
  `finiteRoundToEvenOp_hornerStep_inverseLocalError_of_finiteNormalRange`,
  `fl_hornerDerivativeDesc_first_derivative_error_bound`,
  `fl_dividedDifferenceFiniteCoeffs_abs_sub_exact_le_scalar_absLProduct_gamma3`,
  `dividedDifferenceResidual_error_bound`,
  `matrixPolynomialP3_horner_infNorm_error_bound_first_order_remainder`,
  `fl_rootProductEval_forward_error_bound`.

- Fresh closure axiom audit (14 load-bearing declarations in
  `Ch5SourceClosure.lean`): every declaration reports exactly
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. This includes the explicit inverse
  and matrix-product declarations, both operational two-sweep theorems, and the
  actual rounded inverse-unwind/residual theorem for (5.12).

- Paterson--Stockmeyer focused build: PASS (3123 jobs). The dedicated
  `Ch5PatersonStockmeyerAxiomAudit.lean` reports no nonstandard axioms for the
  executable equality, operational count split, exact count, storage formula
  and bound, or packaged p. 102 source theorem.

- **Historical selected-scope gate: PASS** (2026-07-14, superseded by the
  2026-07-18 strict audit below). Both primary labels (Algorithm 5.1
  Horner, Algorithm 5.2 derivative evaluation) are VERIFIED at printed strength; the previously-MISSING
  Algorithm 5.2 rounding analysis + the ψ(p,x) sign-pattern corollary are now closed in
  `NumStability/Algorithms/Ch5DerivativeError.lean` (`ch5deriv_*` value/derivative forward+backward
  bounds; `ch5psi_*` nonneg / alternating-sign perfect-relative-accuracy corollaries), axiom-clean.
  At that historical checkpoint, the Newton-form §5.3 evaluation error,
  monotone-node-ordering corollary to (5.11)/(5.12), and Algorithm 5.1
  complex-data remark were recorded as optional residuals; all three have
  since been closed.

## Primary Labels

| Label | Printed statement (summary) | Status | Lean decls | Scope notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Algorithm 5.1 (Horner with running error bound, §5.1) | Evaluate `y = fl(p(x))` by Horner's rule and a quantity `mu = u*(2*mu' - \|y\|)` with `\|y - p(x)\| <= mu`; for complex data replace `u` by `sqrt(2)*gamma_2` | **VERIFIED** (real and complex data) | Real surface: `fl_hornerRunningStep`, `fl_hornerRunningState`, `fl_hornerRunningBound`, `fl_hornerDesc_running_error_bound_of_inverseLocal`; concrete round-to-even discharge: `finiteRoundToEvenOp_hornerStep_inverseLocalError_of_finiteNormalRange`. Complex actual-executor surface: `fl_complexHornerStep`, `fl_complexHornerRunningState`, `fl_complexHornerRunningBound`, `fl_complexHornerStep_inverse_error_bound`, `fl_complexHornerDesc_running_error_bound`. | The real theorem uses the source (5.4) inverse local estimate, concretely discharged under finite-normal-range conditions. The complex theorem has only `gammaValid fp 2`: it derives the local estimate directly from the actual Chapter 3 rounded complex addition/multiplication error theorems and carries the same exact-real accumulator idealization as the source. |
| Algorithm 5.2 (polynomial and first k derivatives at alpha, §5.2) | `y_i = p^(i)(alpha)`, `i = 0:k`, by repeated synthetic division + factorial scaling; error analysis (5.5)–(5.7) for the first derivative | **VERIFIED** | Exact all-order identification: `polyDescHigherDeriv_eq_hornerFormalDerivativeFunctionDesc`; actual rounded all-order executor/budget: `fl_hornerTaylorFunctionDesc`, `fl_hornerHigherDerivativeOutput(s)`, `fl_hornerTaylorFunctionDesc_error_bound`, `fl_hornerHigherDerivativeOutput(s)_error_bound`; operational matrix route in `Ch5SourceClosure.lean`; first-derivative chain below | Every order is identified with the independently differentiated Horner recurrence, and every rounded factorial-scaled output is bounded from the same actual execution, including its final rounded scale multiplication. The literal (5.5)–(5.6) two-sweep matrix route and final (5.7) bound are both closed. |

## Numbered Equations

| Eq. | Printed content | Status | Lean decls / notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| (5.1) | `p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + ... + a_n x^n`; Horner recurrence; 2n flops | **VERIFIED** (definition row) | `polyDesc`, `hornerStep`, `hornerDesc`, `hornerDesc_eq_polyDesc` (descending-list convention documented in module header). Flop count not formalized (editorial). |
| (5.2) | Backward error: `qhat_0 = (1+theta_1)a_0 + (1+theta_3)a_1 x + ... + (1+theta_2n)a_n x^n`, `\|theta_k\| <= gamma_k` | **VERIFIED** (uniform-`gamma_2n` form) | `fl_hornerFold_backward_error_coefficients`, `fl_hornerDesc_backward_error_coefficients`: rounded Horner = exact evaluation of coefficientwise-perturbed polynomial, every perturbation `<= gamma fp (2*(len-1))`. This matches the prose conclusion ("relative perturbations of size at most gamma_2n"). The finer per-index ladder (`theta_{2i+1}` for `a_i`, `theta_{2n}` for `a_n`) is not separately stated — recorded as a sharpness note, not a gap (all printed consequences use the uniform form). Hypothesis `gammaValid` (= `2n*u < 1`) is the standard printed applicability condition. |
| (5.3) | Forward bound `\|p(x) - qhat_0\| <= gamma_2n * ptilde(\|x\|)` | **VERIFIED** | `fl_hornerDesc_forward_error_bound` with majorant `polyDescAbs` (= `ptilde(\|x\|)`); adapter `abs_polyDescPairsPerturbed_sub_polyDescPairs_le`. |
| ψ display (unnumbered, §5.1) | Relative bound `\|p-qhat\|/\|p\| <= gamma_2n * psi(p,x)`; `psi = 1` if `a_i >= 0, x >= 0` (or alternating signs, `x <= 0`) | **VERIFIED** | `ch5psi_*` in `Ch5DerivativeError.lean` supplies the ψ relative surface and the nonnegative/alternating-sign perfect-relative-accuracy corollaries. |
| (5.4) | Local step model `(1+eps_i) qhat_i = x*qhat_{i+1}(1+delta_i) + a_i`, `\|delta_i\|,\|eps_i\| <= u` (models (2.4)+(2.5)) | **VERIFIED** | Forward form: `fl_hornerStep_unroll`, `fl_hornerStep_forward_local_error_bound`; inverse (source) form: `hornerStepInverseLocalError` + algebraic bridges `hornerStep_abs_error_le_of_mul_forward_add_inverse` / `..._of_mul_add_error_bounds` (underflow-tolerant variant); discharged concretely by `finiteRoundToEvenOp_hornerStep_inverseLocalError_of_finiteNormalRange` under finite-normal-range hypotheses (the printed domain of (2.5)). Abstract `FPModel` alone supplies only the forward form — honestly flagged in docstrings. |
| `f_i`/`pi_i`/`mu_i` recurrences (unnumbered, §5.1) | Majorizing sequences leading to Algorithm 5.1 | **VERIFIED** (as embedded invariants) | `fl_hornerRunningStep_error_bound_of_inverseLocal`, `fl_hornerRunningFold_error_bound_of_inverseLocal`, `fl_hornerRunningState_abs_fst_le_two_mu`, nonnegativity lemmas; exact-arithmetic mirror `hornerRunningStep/State/Bound` (Algorithm 5.1 shape). |
| Synthetic division displays (§5.2) | `p(x) = (x-alpha) q(x) + r`, `r = q_0 = p(alpha)`, `p'(alpha) = q(alpha)`, divided-difference remark | **VERIFIED** | `hornerSyntheticDivisionDesc_spec`, `hornerSyntheticQuotientDesc_eval_eq_polyDescDeriv`, `hornerSyntheticQuotientDesc_spec`-family; the `q(x) = (p(x)-p(alpha))/(x-alpha)` remark is an immediate rearrangement of the proved spec (not separately stated). The Taylor-expansion output surface is covered by the verified Algorithm 5.2 chain. |
| (5.5) | Bidiagonal system `U_{n+1} q = a`; `(U+Delta_1)qhat = a`, `\|Delta_1\| <= u\|U\|`; `\|q-qhat\| <= u\|U^{-1}\|\|U\|\|q\| + O(u^2)` | **VERIFIED** | `highamBidiagonalUInv` has left/right inverse proofs; `flHighamBidiagonalSolve` is the actual rounded executor; `flHighamBidiagonalDelta` and `flHighamBidiagonalSolve_backward_perturbation` prove its literal perturbed system and componentwise `u\|U\|` bound. `flHighamBidiagonalSolve_forward_error_first_order_quadratic` is now the printed exact-`q` endpoint: `u |U^{-1}||U||q| + highamBidiagonalEq55QuadraticRemainder`, where the named remainder is exactly `u^2 (|U^{-1}||U|)^2 |qhat|`, nonnegative by `highamBidiagonalEq55QuadraticRemainder_nonneg`. The genuine primitive inverse-addition model (2.5), `inverseRelErrorModel (fp.fl_add x y) (x+y) u`, is the only extra input, not a target-equivalent error assumption. |
| (5.6) | `\|r - rhat\| <= u\|U_n^{-1}\|\|U_n\|\|r\| + u\|U_n^{-1}\|\|U_{n+1}^{-1}\|\|U_{n+1}\|\|q\| + O(u^2)`; the three displayed `\|U\|`-product matrices | **VERIFIED** | `flHighamBidiagonalSolve_two_sweeps_backward_perturbation` constructs both actual rounded solves and both printed perturbation systems. `flHighamBidiagonalSolve_two_sweeps_forward_error_first_order_quadratic` is the literal exact-`r`/exact-`q` endpoint, with the tail-index bridge between the `(n+1)` and `n` systems. Its `O(u^2)` is the sum of explicit `highamBidiagonalEq56PropagationQuadraticRemainder` and `highamBidiagonalEq56CrossQuadraticRemainder`; both have a visible `u^2` factor and are jointly nonnegative by `highamBidiagonalEq56QuadraticRemainders_nonneg`. The three source matrices are closed entrywise by `highamBidiagonalUInv_abs_entry`, `highamBidiagonalAbsInv_mul_absU_entry`, and `highamBidiagonalAbsInv_mul_absInv_mul_absU_entry` (with convolution bridge `highamBidiagonalUInv_square_entry`), yielding diagonal `1`, strict-upper `2\|alpha\|^{j-i}`, and strict-upper `(2(j-i)+1)\|alpha\|^{j-i}` respectively. |
| (5.7) | `\|p'(alpha) - rhat_0\| <= 2u * sum k^2\|a_k\|\|alpha\|^{k-1} + O(u^2) <= 2nu * ptilde'(alpha) + O(u^2)` | **VERIFIED** (final display, exact remainder) | Direct coupled route: `fl_hornerDerivativeDesc_snd_backward_error_coefficients_coupled` (derivative output = exact FORMAL derivative of a `gamma_2n`-perturbed polynomial), `fl_hornerDerivativeDesc_snd_forward_error_bound_coupled` (`gamma_2n * ptilde'`), and the printed first-order display `fl_hornerDerivativeDesc_first_derivative_error_bound` = `2n*u*ptilde'(x)` + named exact remainder `fl_hornerDerivativeDescFirstOrderRemainder` (provably 0 at `u = 0`, explicitly quadratic in `n*u`) — the `O(u^2)` is replaced by an exact closed-form remainder, which is stronger than printed. The intermediate `2u*sum k^2\|a_k\|\|alpha\|^{k-1}` display (k^2 weights) is not separately stated; the Lean constant `gamma_2n * k`-weights sits between the two printed displays. Alternative majorant-budget routes also present (`..._with_derivAbs_and_source_majorant`, `..._first_order_source_remainder`). |
| (5.8) | Newton form `p(x) = sum c_i prod_{j<i}(x - alpha_j)` | **VERIFIED** (definition row) | `newtonFormAux`, `newtonForm`, `newtonFormNested`, `newtonForm_eq_newtonFormNested`. |
| Divided-difference recurrence (boxed, §5.3) | `c_j^{(k+1)} = (c_j^{(k)} - c_{j-1}^{(k)})/(alpha_j - alpha_{j-k-1})`; 3n²/2 flops | **VERIFIED** (definition row) | `dividedDifferenceStep`, `dividedDifferenceCoeffs`, `dividedDifferenceFiniteCoeffs` (+ `L_k = D_k^{-1} M_k` structure via `dividedDifferenceLMatrix(Action)` and equivalence `dividedDifferenceLMatrixAction_eq_step`, `dividedDifferenceFiniteCoeffs_eq_LProductAction`). Flop count not formalized (editorial). |
| (5.9) | `chat^{(k+1)} = G_k L_k chat^{(k)}`, `eta_ij = (1+delta_1)(1+delta_2)(1+delta_3)` | **VERIFIED** | `fl_dividedDifferenceStep`, `fl_dividedDifferenceStep_entry_error_factors` (exact triple-factor form), `fl_dividedDifferenceStep_entry_gamma3`, `dividedDifferenceGMatrix(Action)`, `dividedDifferenceGMatrixAction_LMatrixAction_eq`, finite adapters `fl_dividedDifferenceStep_exists_GMatrixAction_gamma3`. Hypotheses: distinct nodes (printed) plus `fl_sub(nodes) != 0` (rounded denominators nonzero — an added no-degenerate-rounding side condition, honestly stated; automatic in the printed real-arithmetic idealization). |
| (5.10) | `chat = (L_{n-1}+DeltaL_{n-1})...(L_0+DeltaL_0) f`, `\|DeltaL_i\| <= gamma_3 \|L_i\|` | **VERIFIED** (equivalent `G*L`-product form) | `fl_dividedDifferenceFiniteCoeffs_eq_GLProductAction_of_row_factors`, `fl_dividedDifferenceFiniteCoeffs_exists_GLProductAction_gamma3` (`\|eta - 1\| <= gamma_3` per active row; `G_k L_k = L_k + DeltaL_k` with `\|DeltaL_k\| <= gamma_3\|L_k\|` is the same statement). |
| (5.11) | `\|c - chat\| <= ((1-3u)^{-n} - 1) \|L_{n-1}\|...\|L_0\| \|f\|` | **VERIFIED** | `fl_dividedDifferenceFiniteCoeffs_abs_sub_exact_le_absLProduct_gap_gamma3` (gap form) and the printed scalar-constant form `fl_dividedDifferenceFiniteCoeffs_abs_sub_exact_le_scalar_absLProduct_gamma3`: constant `(1+gamma_3)^m - 1` which equals `(1-3u)^{-m} - 1` exactly (`1 + gamma_3 = 1/(1-3u)`); majorant `dividedDifferenceAbsLProductAction ... \|f\|` = `\|L_{m-1}\|...\|L_0\|\|f\|`. The monotone-ordering identity and “very satisfactory bound” are closed by `ch5newton_absLProduct_entry_eq_abs` and `ch5newton_dividedDifference_verySatisfactory`. |
| (5.12) | Residual unwind: `\|f - L^{-1} chat\| <= ((1-3u)^{-n} - 1)\|L_0^{-1}\|...\|L_{n-1}^{-1}\|\|chat\|` | **VERIFIED** | `fl_dividedDifferenceStep_entry_inverse_gamma3` derives the inverse factor for each actual rounded recurrence entry; `fl_dividedDifferenceFiniteCoeffs_succ_exists_unwind_gamma3` and `fl_dividedDifferenceFiniteCoeffs_exists_inverse_unwind_gamma3` construct and compose the concrete inverse steps. The final `fl_dividedDifferenceFiniteCoeffs_residual_error_bound_gamma3` now requires only exact nonzero denominators and `gammaValid fp 3`: `fl_sub_ne_zero_of_exact_ne_zero_of_gammaValid_three` derives every rounded denominator's nonbreakdown from `fl_sub = (exact subtraction)(1+delta)`, `|delta| <= u < 1`. The endpoint has the exact `(1+gamma_3)^m-1 = (1-3u)^{-m}-1` constant and printed absolute inverse-product majorant. |
| Newton-evaluation displays (unnumbered, §5.3 end) | Generalized Horner for the Newton form: `qhat_0 = c_0<1> + (x-alpha_0)c_1<4> + ... + (...)c_n<3n>`; forward bound `gamma_3n * sum \|c_i\| prod \|x - alpha_j\|` | **VERIFIED** | `ch5newton_fleval`, `ch5newton_backward_error`, and `ch5newton_forward_error_bound` in `Ch5NewtonForm.lean` give the actual rounded generalized-Horner evaluator, `<3n>` backward representation, and `gamma_3n` forward bound. |
| (5.13a,b) | Leja ordering: `\|alpha_0\| = max`, prefix-product maximization | **VERIFIED** (definition + spec) | `lejaPrefixProduct` (+ lemmas), `IsLejaOrdering`, accessors `IsLejaOrdering.first_abs_max`/`step_product_max`; greedy construction certificate `LejaGreedyFirstChoice/StepChoice`, `IsLejaGreedyTrace`, `IsLejaGreedyTrace.isLejaOrdering`. |
| (5.14) and preceding p. 102 fast-evaluation paragraph | Matrix polynomials `P1`, `P2`, `P3(X) = A_0 + A_1 X + ... + A_n X^n`; Paterson--Stockmeyer evaluates P1 with matrix multiplications proportional to `√n` and extra storage proportional to `m²√n` elements | **VERIFIED** | Complex definitions and exact Horner realizations: `complexMatrixPolyP1Desc` / `complexMatrixHornerP1Desc_eq_complexMatrixPolyP1Desc`, the corresponding `P2` pair, and the corresponding `P3` pair. `higham5PatersonStockmeyerHorner` is the source-dimensional `Fin (n+1) → ℂ`, `m×m` block-Horner evaluator; `higham5_patersonStockmeyerHorner_eq_P1` proves exact equality. `higham5_ps_matrix_multiplications_operational` connects the actual baby-power/Horner phases, `higham5_ps_matrix_multiplications_exact` gives exactly `2⌊√n⌋`, and `higham5_ps_stored_elements_le` gives `(⌊√n⌋+4)m² ≤ 5m²⌊√n⌋` for `n>0`. The older real `P3` stability development remains available for Problem 5.6. |

## Problems (optional in core mode)

| Problem | Status | Lean decls / notes |
|---|---|---|
| 5.1 (derive Algorithm 5.2 by differentiating Horner) | **VERIFIED** | `hornerTaylorFunctionStep/Desc` is the differentiated Horner recurrence on unscaled Taylor coefficients; `polyDescHigherDeriv_eq_hornerFormalDerivativeFunctionDesc` identifies every order with the independently iterated formal derivative, and factorial rescaling yields the printed outputs. |
| 5.2 (error analysis of the "beginner's" power-building algorithm) | **VERIFIED** (budget form) | `beginnerPowerStep/EvalAsc` (+ exact correctness `beginnerPowerEvalAsc_eq_polyAsc`), `fl_beginnerPowerStep/EvalAsc`, recursive budget `beginnerPowerForwardBudget(From)`, bound `fl_beginnerPowerEvalAsc_forward_error_bound(_poly)`. The analysis is an exact a posteriori budget over all 3 rounded ops per term rather than a closed `gamma_k * ptilde` display — a genuine (indeed sharper) error analysis; closed-form display not extracted. |
| 5.3 (even/odd splitting error bound) | **VERIFIED** (budget form) | `evenCoeffsAsc`/`oddCoeffsAsc`, exact split `polyAsc_evenOdd_split`, `evenOddSplitEvalAsc(_eq_polyAsc)`, rounded evaluator `fl_evenOddSplitHornerEvalAsc`, budget `evenOddSplitForwardBudget`, bound `fl_evenOddSplitHornerEvalAsc_forward_error_bound` (includes the `y = x*x` argument-perturbation term via `polyAsc_arg_error_bound`). Same budget-form note as 5.2. |
| 5.4 (Leja ordering algorithm in n² flops) | **VERIFIED** (spec level) | Greedy-trace certificate (`IsLejaGreedyTrace`) proved to satisfy (5.13); flop budget `lejaGreedyFlopCount` with `lejaGreedyFlopCount_eq_square` (`= n^2` exactly). No executable/computable implementation of the ordering — recorded as a note, adequate for the "write down an algorithm + count flops" ask at spec level. |
| 5.5 (error analysis of root-product evaluation) | **VERIFIED** | `rootProductEval(From)`, `fl_rootProductEval(From)`, counter form `fl_rootProductEvalFrom_exists_relErrorCounter` (exactly `2n` relative-error factors, i.e. `phat = p*<2n>`), relative bound `fl_rootProductEval_forward_error_bound` (`gamma_2n * \|p(x)\|`) — the natural printed-strength answer. |
| 5.6 (Horner for `P3`: `\|P3 - P3hat\| <= n(m+1)u ptilde_3(\|X\|) + O(u^2)`, 1- and inf-norms) | **VERIFIED** (real entries; exact remainder) | Full chain: `fl_matAdd`/`fl_matMul` norm error bounds, majorants `matrixPolyP3{Inf,OneNorm}Majorant` (= `ptilde_3(\|X\|)`), budgets, geometric closure `matrixPolynomialP3_horner_{infNorm,oneNorm}_error_bound_geometric`, and the printed first-order display `matrixPolynomialP3_horner_{infNorm,oneNorm}_error_bound_first_order_remainder`: coefficient `degree * (m+1) * u` (Lean `(coeffsDesc.length - 1) * ((n:R)+1) * fp.u`, matrix dimension `n` = book's `m`) times `ptilde_3`, plus named exact remainder `matrixHornerP3GeometricFirstOrderRemainder` (0 at `u = 0`). Both norms as printed. Real entries vs the book's `C^{m x m}` — noted. |
| 5.7 (research problem: stability of fast evaluation schemes) | **SKIP-OK** (research problem; explicitly open in the source) | No formalization expected. |

## Honest-Strength Notes

1. **No hidden target-equivalent hypotheses found in the closed rows.** The
   hypothesis-shaped devices are primitive-operation/domain assumptions:
   `hornerStepInverseLocalError` for (5.4), the equivalent per-addition
   `inverseRelErrorModel` used by the literal matrix executor, and nonzero exact
   divided-difference denominators. The former is discharged for
   concrete round-to-even under finite-normal-range conditions; rounded
   denominator nonbreakdown follows from exact nonbreakdown plus `gammaValid fp 3`; the (5.12)
   perturbed inverse steps and reconstruction equality are now constructed from
   the actual rounded recurrence rather than assumed.
2. **Constants are derived, not assumed**: `gamma_2n` in (5.2)/(5.3), `(1+gamma_3)^n - 1 = (1-3u)^{-n} - 1`
   in (5.11)/(5.12), `2nu + exact remainder` in (5.7), `n(m+1)u + exact remainder` in Problem 5.6. Where the
   book writes `O(u^2)`, the Lean statements carry named exact remainders that vanish at `u = 0` and are
   explicitly quadratic in the accumulated roundoff — stronger than printed.
3. **Conventions**: coefficient lists are descending `[a_n, ..., a_0]` (`polyDesc`) or ascending (`polyAsc`,
   Problems 5.2/5.3); `p'` is the formal coefficient derivative (`polyDescDeriv`), which is the printed
   object; divided differences use function-indexed nodes with `Fin (n+1)` finite columns.
4. **Scalar/complex scope**: the original scalar Horner development remains over
   `R`; `HighamChapter5ComplexAlgorithm51.lean` supplies the distinct actual
   complex Algorithm 5.1 executor and the Lemma 3.5 `sqrt(2)*gamma_2` running
   bound. Equation (5.14) is formalized over complex matrices for all three
   `P1`/`P2`/`P3` orientations, with exact Horner realizations. The separate
   Paterson--Stockmeyer closure also uses the literal complex scalar
   coefficients and complex `m×m` matrix dimensions; its resource theorem is
   attached to the operational power-chain and block-Horner phases rather than
   to the unrelated scalar quartic evaluator.
5. A docstring citation without an attached genuine theorem was NOT counted anywhere in this ledger; every
   VERIFIED row above names the theorem whose statement was read and matched against the printed row.

## Selected-scope gate: PASS (fresh strict audit and repair, 2026-07-18)

**Update (2026-07-14 audit-closure):** row 2 below (ψ sign-pattern) and the Algorithm 5.2 derivative
rounding analysis are now CLOSED in `NumStability/Algorithms/Ch5DerivativeError.lean`
(`ch5deriv_value_forward_error_bound`, `ch5deriv_derivative_forward_error_bound`,
`ch5deriv_derivative_backward_error_coefficients`, `ch5deriv_pair_forward_error_bound`;
`ch5psi_*` for the nonneg / strictly-alternating perfect-relative-accuracy corollaries), axiom-clean.
Both primary labels are VERIFIED.

**Follow-up (2026-07-17):** the Newton-form §5.3 analysis and the monotone-ordering corollary are now
CLOSED in `NumStability/Algorithms/Ch5NewtonForm.lean` (`ch5newton_backward_error` = the `<3n>`
backward result for the rounded generalized-Horner Newton-form evaluator; `ch5newton_forward_error_bound`;
plus the strictly-increasing-node corollary `|L_{n-1}|...|L_0| = |L|`), axiom-clean.

The former Algorithm 5.1 complex-data residual is CLOSED by
`fl_complexHornerDesc_running_error_bound`, with the actual executor and the
literal `sqrt(2)*gamma_2*(2*mu - |y|)` coefficient.

**Follow-up (2026-07-18 strict repair):** the selected residuals at (5.5),
(5.6), and (5.12) are CLOSED in
`NumStability/Algorithms/Ch5SourceClosure.lean`. The new proofs instantiate
both rounded bidiagonal solves, prove all three displayed inverse-product
matrices, and give the printed exact-`q`/exact-`r` first-order terms with named
quadratic propagation and cross remainders. The actual divided-difference
inverse unwind is constructed, and its final endpoint derives rounded
denominator nonbreakdown instead of requiring it from the caller. The focused
axiom audit reports only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Headline verdict for the audit brief: **Algorithm 5.1 + (5.2)/(5.3) gamma_2n backward/forward Horner theorems
are genuinely formalized at printed strength (axiom-clean); the Algorithm 5.2 first-derivative analysis is
closed both through the literal operational (5.5)/(5.6) matrix route and at the
printed (5.7) display with exact remainders; the concrete rounded inverse-unwind
producer closes (5.12). The selected-scope gate is PASS.**

## Cross-Chapter Role

- **§1.17 (Rump/Kahan rational-function example)**: `kahanHorner*` decls (see README core-theory table) reuse
  the Horner surfaces for the nonrandom-rounding case study.
- **Chapter 3**: this chapter is the canonical consumer of Lemma 3.1/`gamma_k` algebra
  (`gamma_mul`, `gamma_eq_linear_plus_quadratic_remainder`) and of the §3.3 running-error-analysis pattern;
  the running-bound machinery here is the template later running bounds cite.
- **Chapter 22 (Vandermonde systems)**: divided differences, the Newton form (5.8), the `L_k` factorization,
  and the Leja ordering (5.13, §22.3.3) are the direct inputs to the ch22 primal/dual Vandermonde algorithms;
  the (5.9)–(5.12) machinery formalized here is the natural substrate for the ch22 error analyses.
- **Matrix-function chapters / P1 evaluation**: the (5.14)/Problem 5.6 matrix-Horner engine (norm-level matmul
  error propagation, `ptilde_3` majorants) is reusable wherever matrix polynomials are evaluated
  (including the now-closed Paterson--Stockmeyer P1 evaluator; cf. [509, Chap. 11] citations in the source).
- **Chapter 28.6 / zero-finding**: Algorithm 5.1's stopping-criterion use for polynomial zero-finders is
  editorial here; no ch28 consumer yet.

## Current import navigation after the identity migration

Use `ComputationalMathematics.Source.Higham.Chapter05` for current source navigation. The
[identity migration](../migrations/lean-computational-mathematics/README.md)
retains the old import paths and authored `NumStability` declaration names.
Earlier paths, commands, audit dates and coverage decisions in this ledger
remain evidence of their original snapshots; this navigation note does not
claim a fresh source-faithfulness audit or change any source status.
